At the time, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA, now known as ESA) decided to announce their own trade show for video games, which would be the E3 we know today. That\u2019s the short of it, at least.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>E3 officially started in 1995\u00a0and was an \u201cindustry only\u201d event, meaning you were required by the ESA to prove you had industry credentials and\/or a professional connection to get in. With E3 being such a large, high-profile event &#8211; doubled by it being so difficult to get in &#8211; E3 held an air of mystique about it, garnering a very enigmatic reputation.

I was newly 20, E3 was my first gaming event, and I was over the moon excited about it. I had spent years prior watching footage on G4TV and wishing I could be Morgan Webb from X-Play covering the event. The coverage on TV and internet could not do justice to the sheer enormity that was E3. Granted, I was young and in love with video games, and, this\u00a0being my first event, I was feeling pretty cool about garnering a media pass. I have gone nearly every year since, and while nothing compares to your first E3, there is still an air of magic to attending. I have been to dozens of the PAX events, and still E3 was always The One for me. Still,\u00a0as with any good relationship, things can often end up tumultuous.<\/p>\n<p>There is something to be said about the exclusivity of E3 aiding to its appeal. There is a Psychology behind wanting to sit at the popular table, and for a long time the E3 exclusivity gave a lot of people serious fear of missing out. After all, there&#8217;s nothing like a someone saying &#8220;you can&#8217;t sit with us&#8221; to make you want to sit with them &#8211; especially if they&#8217;re the cool kids.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9781\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9781\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us2.png\" alt=\"You Cant Sit With Us Mean girls\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us2.png 500w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us2-320x207.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stop trying to make the Gameboy Micro happen!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>E3 has evolved a lot since its incarnation in 1995, and will no doubt to continue to evolve. Its current announcement in evolution has caused some divisiveness in the community. Recently, a lot of big players have dropped out of E3, including Wargaming, Activision, EA and Disney Interactive &#8211; which had always had impressive setups on the show floor. With the departure of these and others leaving, the gaps are filled with companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/explore\/articles\/2016\/06\/13\/what-happened-at-bethesdas-e3-show\/\">Bethesda, who gave its first ever press conference in 2016<\/a>. To further combat the loss of these players, E3 announced, that for the first time ever, it will sell a limited number of public passes. A lot of E3 alumni were up in arms about this, citing it takes away from the professional atmosphere of the event, fills up the \u201cgood hotels\u201d, and that inviting 15,000 from the public to attend will create longer lines and a more congested event. While industry vets were dubious, many felt joy for people who would never be able to go otherwise. While the inclusiveness is wonderful, make no mistake &#8211; this is about E3 recouping funds and nothing else.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I can play both sides, but I keep going back to when I was 20 years old, walking into the convention center and being unbelievably moved and in awe. This will likely be a similar dream come true to nearly 15,000 new attendees and at the end of the day, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me, personally. Professionally, I will book my hotel yesterday and make sure I flash my press badge like an FBI agent to move in lines to get game coverage.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9782\" style=\"width: 724px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Dana-Scully.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9782\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Dana-Scully.jpg\" alt=\"Agent Scully x files fbi badge\" width=\"714\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Dana-Scully.jpg 714w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Dana-Scully-320x240.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Dana-Scully-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Current mood: Agent Scully having to show her badge for the 2,837,983,742th time<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Will E3 keep this public format? What does this mean for Press\/Media registration? Time will tell. This E3 will prove to be a pinnacle play in the show&#8217;s future. While selling tickets ($250 bucks a pop!) is a marginally decent way to recoup the loss of bigger companies moving in a different direction, I think it would also be prudent for E3 to rethink its current model. Perhaps it should take a cue from PAX and make it more affordable for indies to come to the show floor. It is hard to deny the importance of indies and the insurmountable growth and popularity of indie studios and their subsequent games, and E3 is out of reach for so many of these up-and-coming titles. Regardless of the direction E3 decides to move in, we\u2019re excited for you first-timers to have an incredible gaming experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, started off as an extension of\u00a0another wildly popular trade show called Consumer Electronics Show (CES), eventually parting ways from the event.

I started out on a PC, a seemingly rare thing for gamers apparently. \u00a0However, keeping up with the Joneses (Gates?) was costly, so my PC became unplayable within a few short years. I was still playing the NES well into the mid &#8217;90s, but only\u00a0because the 16 bit generation was slightly out of my family&#8217;s disposable income reach.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t all that bad, though &#8211; I enjoyed playing and replaying the few games I had for the NES, and since I was still just starting elementary school I didn&#8217;t really know what I was missing anyway. I didn&#8217;t mind just playing the NES by myself for hours on end, focused on completing the seemingly impossible goal of beating Super Mario Bros. 3\u00a0without my dad&#8217;s help.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t like that forever though; we had a few good Christmases. Occasionally, something amazing would fall off the back of Santa&#8217;s sleigh and land\u00a0under the Christmas tree. On those rare happy times, I&#8217;d receive a new console, like the N64 (which came bundled with DK64) and the PS2 (which was gifted to me alongside Kingdom Hearts).<\/p>\n<p>Like before, my preference for single player sessions dominated each console and, ultimately, my game choice. I gravitated more towards RPGs and away from the FPS and fighting games my friends preferred. Where my peers seemingly only desired a social gaming experience, I wanted to be immersed in a story for hours of solitary amusement. While my\u00a0buddies played Goldeneye, Doom, Mario Kart, and Street Fighter, I preferred Mario 64, Katamari Damacy, Final Fantasy, and Civilization.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9668\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/sid-meiers-civilization_14.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-9668 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/sid-meiers-civilization_14.png\" alt=\"Civilization DOS Game PC Original 1991 Single Player\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/sid-meiers-civilization_14.png 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/sid-meiers-civilization_14-320x200.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Civilization: a historically accurate good time!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Of course, there were some games I played with friends (or were more at least forced to, I should say). Pokemon required fellow trainers to complete a full Pokedex. Mario Party offered hours of entertainment. I played both of these titles with friends more because I wanted to play the game and less because I wanted to play with any given person. Not that I hated my friends or anything, but if I wanted to be social I would rather ride bikes or play basketball. Video games were&#8230;y&#8217;know. My thing.<\/p>\n<p>20 years later and I still play the exact same way. I stick to single player games and rarely venture out of that arena. There&#8217;s just something about the single player experience that feels effortless and relaxing. Civilization, Final Fantasy, and Katamari are still staples in my gaming library, but so are games like Skyrim, Phoenix Wright, and Saints Row.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9669\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9669 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04-960x540.jpg\" alt=\"Saints Row Gat Outta Hell Chair Gun Single Player \" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04-960x540.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04-320x180.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/SRsc04-640x360.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Okay but honestly, you should all have this game.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The difference between now and then, however, is that the single player experience is no longer an attractive selling point. In fact, the opposite is usually true: games, especially those of the AAA variety, are consistently being marketed as multiplayer and co-op experiences. Even freemium games like Pokemon Go are hailed as revolutionary for getting people off their couches and out into the open with *gasp* <em>other people.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Coupled with the fact that sales of traditionally amazing franchises, like Final Fantasy, are dwindling. Of course, this is the fault of poor content; nevertheless, single player\u00a0games are <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/community\/2014\/06\/16\/is-single-player-dying-the-move-to-multiplayer-and-the-sacrifice-of-solitude\/\">seeing dwindling sales overall<\/a>. This certainly can&#8217;t bode well for those of us that prefer the genres dedicated to this experience. Are we &#8211; the single player gamers &#8211; a dying breed?<\/p>\n<p>Now I know I&#8217;m not alone in being&#8230;well alone. There&#8217;s gotta be plenty of gamers out there like me. Gamers that prefer the quiet solitude of retreating to their console or PC at the end of the day and blocking everyone &#8211; and I mean everyone &#8211; out for the rest of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>So where does that leave the gamer that doesn&#8217;t like co-op?<\/p>\n<p>Obviously RPGs and other single player games exist, but they don&#8217;t sell like\u00a0games that provide co-op experiences such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/2016\/10\/26\/by-the-numbers-call-of-dutys-massive-sales\/\">Call of Duty<\/a>. While this hasn&#8217;t stopped other non co-op\u00a0games from coming to fruition, it does pose a potential problem in the future. If money talks, and it does, the likelihood of single player games being the powerhouse that they once were seems bleak.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to a possible dwindling of games, there are these things called\u00a0&#8220;communities&#8221;. They&#8217;ve sprung up within the last decade or so and are completely and utterly foreign to me. While the <a href=\"https:\/\/discordapp.com\/invite\/YaVMY5P\">EquityArcade discord<\/a> is pretty freakin&#8217; sweet, I&#8217;ll admit this is a new, unfamiliar venture for me. Yet this is exactly what the trend is going towards &#8211; community, inclusion, friends&#8230;social gaming. Not that I don&#8217;t want it but&#8230;at the same time&#8230;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9673\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/i-want-to-have-a-social-life-but-i-hate-people-quote-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9673 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/i-want-to-have-a-social-life-but-i-hate-people-quote-1.jpg\" alt=\"First world problems single player i hate people\" width=\"620\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/i-want-to-have-a-social-life-but-i-hate-people-quote-1.jpg 620w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/i-want-to-have-a-social-life-but-i-hate-people-quote-1-320x211.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hate is a strong word, but I really, really, really don&#8217;t like them&#8230;in my games.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In the future, I imagine games will focus more and more on social experiences.

I think it is relatively safe to say that within our community, one of the most notable and effective ways to \u201cstruggle to deal\u201d is with video games.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9773\" style=\"width: 583px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Stress.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9773\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Stress.jpg\" alt=\"Stress video game therapy\" width=\"573\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Stress.jpg 573w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Stress-320x201.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get this man some vidya &#8211; stat!<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a friend reach out and tell me that after a really bad breakup, he turned to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Halo 3<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Why this game in particular? I spent some time thinking about this, and came to the realization that this is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> game that feels like home.

If you don&#8217;t have a video game that feels like \u201chome\u201d yet, I can almost promise you that you will. Regardless, we as a community of gamers turn to gaming as an obvious solution in distraction and entertainment &#8211; doubly so when we feel alone in this unpredictable world. We are lucky to have a community of people to virtually rest our heads on through these rough times. This community is constantly growing at a Sonic pace (see what we did there), and through communicable advances like Discord, Twitch, and video game-centric events, these friends are more real and subsequently offer a much warmer solace when our hearts are destroyed on some <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Fantasy VII<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Aerith level shit.

Think of it as low-key and often times subliminal peer pressure. You\u2019re part of a group of peers with one steadfast idea, motive or opinion in common. Before you can think for yourself, you\u2019re part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spring.org.uk\/2009\/09\/how-groups-form-conform-then-warp-our-decision-making-productivity-and-creativity.php\">decentralized decision making<\/a>. We\u2019ve all fallen to the whim of mob mentality on different moral and ethical levels; there is a social psychology behind how and why. The brain has a tendency to go into a sort of auto-pilot and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/mob-mentality-brain-suppresses-personal-moral-code-when-groups-288342\">suppress one\u2019s personal moral compass<\/a> when in large groups. Why does the brain do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This mentality goes back to our deepest, basest, most instinctual roots. When you are solitary or in small, familiar groups (family, friends, Tuesday yoga\u00a0class, etc) your brain adheres to its \u201cdefault\u201d morality settings. In a large group setting, your brain&#8217;s subliminal desire to fit in switches from <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.brainfacts.org\/2012\/12\/us-and-them-and-our-brains\/#.WKI67FUrKUk\">\u201cme\u201d to \u201cus\u201d or \u201cthem\u201d<\/a> and is often exacerbated by anonymity. When an individual feels their identity is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prisonexp.org\/\">concealed enough in a group to mask their specific actions as an individual<\/a>, the brain subconsciously &#8211; and sometimes consciously &#8211; justifies this behavior. The innate notion that you are protected by a group with no risk of individual repercussion so easily melts away rational judgement and shifts the user into a completely different consciousness; it\u2019s almost a conditioned reflex. Mob Mentality has been around for ages; some pertinent historical examples are The French Revolution, Holocaust, The Salem Witch Trials and our most recent and expansive example&#8230;The Internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9762\" style=\"width: 416px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Kid-surfing-the-internet.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9762\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Kid-surfing-the-internet.jpg\" alt=\"Kid surfing the internet 90s kid keyboard surfing\" width=\"406\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Kid-surfing-the-internet.jpg 406w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Kid-surfing-the-internet-320x355.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mindlessly following the herd?

It&#8217;s gotten to the point where\u00a0it has become such an ingrained aspect of our daily routine that our brain doesn&#8217;t even register that it\u2019s problematic. The internet, despite all it&#8217;s done for the world as a whole, has become a breeding ground for exacerbating mob mentality through social media, internet forums like Reddit and 4chan, and even inciting mob ideas through questionable and uninformed \u201cnews\u201d articles. You ever scroll through Facebook and see an absurd article titled something like \u201cBreaking News: Scientists Say Water is Bad For You!\u201d and you see 3,462 comments of people arguing that the article has a point? Yeah, that.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these articles are so prevalent and the mob behavior within the comments is so second nature that you either participate or keep scrolling. While these Facebook dumpster fires are harmless and entertaining enough, not all internet mob mentality is; in fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/12\/01\/health\/teen-suicide-cyberbullying-trnd\/\">it can become extremely dangerous and detrimental to people and their actual lives<\/a> outside of the main-frame.

Perhaps one of the few examples of mob mentality focused on a primarily ethical high-road.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, where things get dicey is individual users coming together in online forums or social medias and losing all inhibition, disassociating\u00a0from their \u201creal world\u201d as they settle down in front of a screen. Disassociation is a spectrum and can not be used as a blanket term in regards to online trolling and mob mentality.

Trolling can be innocent enough &#8211; you\u2019re looking for a laugh so you poke fun at something online, respond exclusively in memes and call it a night.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9760\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Troll-face.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9760\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Troll-face.png\" alt=\"Troll face meme trololol lol internet troll\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Troll-face.png 500w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Troll-face-320x211.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Black Mirror Season 3 Ep 3, anyone?<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be obvious how anonymity aids and abets trolls online, there may be a much larger psychological behavioral background at work here. Within the Dissociation spectrum is something Psychologists call \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15257832\">Disinhibition Effect<\/a>\u201d which is defined as <\/span><b>\u201c<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the reduction or abandonment in remote electronic communications of those social restrictions and inhibitions that would arise in normal face-to-face communication\u201d. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anonymity makes every difference, and unfortunately, this frees some to partake in some pretty egregious behavior. When you are, for all intents and purposes, invisible among a community, you\u2019ll do and say whatever to find acceptance among the herd; because this acceptance is much harder to find offline. We\u2019re all victim to the carnal desire to fit in.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9759\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9759\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us.png\" alt=\"Mean Girls You Can't sit with us on wednesdays we wear pink lindsey lohan\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us.png 500w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/You-Cant-Sit-With-Us-320x207.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">On Wednesdays we wear pink.

When people have the opportunity to separate their actions from their real world and identity, they feel less vulnerable about opening up. Whatever they say or do can&#8217;t be directly linked to the rest of their lives. They don&#8217;t have to own their behavior by acknowledging it within the full context of who they &#8220;really&#8221; are. When acting out hostile feelings, the person doesn&#8217;t have to take responsibility for those actions. In fact, people might even convince themselves that those behaviors &#8220;aren&#8217;t me at all.&#8221; In psychology this is called &#8216;dissociation.&#8217;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Suler, <a href=\"http:\/\/truecenterpublishing.com\/psycyber\/disinhibit.html\">Psychology of the Digital Age<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Where do we draw the line in the proverbial sand between casual internet trolling and harmful mob mentality?

A lot of gamers play co-op games with their online friends, join guilds through games like World of Warcraft, or frequent online gaming forums. Through these activities, we make friends with\u00a0people we will likely never meet in \u201creal life\u201d. The capacity to make friends within Cyber Space is a testament to how something once shamed as an anti-social, indoor-kid hobby is actually a unique exercise in socialization for a community of people with one shared interest; it\u2019s one of the many reasons why gaming is so valuable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-9660 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004-960x546.jpg\" alt=\"PC Gaming eSports Happy gamers smiling online friends\" width=\"768\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004-960x546.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004-320x182.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004-768x437.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004-640x364.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/DSC_1004.jpg 1191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a gamer, you\u2019ve likely made online friends via gaming through some avenue whether it be guildmates, a forum friend, or you played a fire match with a stranger and added each other to subsequently then jump into games every night after work, etc. However you met them, this community offers a wealth of friendship that is only growing that sense of camaraderie through current gaming phenomena such as Twitch and esports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As life does, it gives and it takes&#8230;and it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quite<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often takes. Death can draft in like a breeze and take people from us so swiftly, leaving in its wake many esoteric feelings of morose confusion. When this kind of loss happens to a friend or family member outside the realm of Cyber Space, we grieve and our social circles understand. We are offered sincere, relatable condolences in droves. But what about when that person, for all intents and purposes, only existed to you? Online friends who you never knew in person but connected with just like anyone else within your immediate vicinity? It\u2019s hard to explain the importance of a bond that wasn\u2019t physically tangible to outsiders of your virtual world. How do you grieve? Who do you talk to? Are you justified in feeling such a loss so deeply?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1a42f0dfe23bc8f9a638a5498fcd7473bb65f190_hq.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-9656 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1a42f0dfe23bc8f9a638a5498fcd7473bb65f190_hq.jpg\" alt=\"Online Friends Long Distance Relationship LDR Skype Chatting\" width=\"500\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1a42f0dfe23bc8f9a638a5498fcd7473bb65f190_hq.jpg 500w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1a42f0dfe23bc8f9a638a5498fcd7473bb65f190_hq-320x265.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The answer is simple: yes, of course!

I spent my time in Final Fantasy AOL chatrooms, scrolling through GameFAQS.com, and writing in my Livejournal.

At the time, the friendship may have been considered unusual, as making online friends was still actively discouraged. But he, Ruxpin from Canada, and I, Pryde from Florida, unassumingly maintained a friendship through Livejournal for years, often times playing games of Starcraft together and causing trouble in IIRC groups. We trolled the Something Awful forums together, and when World of Warcraft came out in 2004, we joined the Something Awful guild \u201cGoon Squad\u201d on the Mal\u2019Ganis server; he an Undead Rogue and I a Troll Warrior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We put years into the game together, spending many late nights talking on Ventrillo.

I moved around a lot and was not online and in touch as I used to be. Every few months he would call me to \u201ccheck in\u201d and make sure I was okay &#8211; something I can\u2019t say anyone else has ever done for me. Once my life settled down, we got back into our gaming routine and would often chat on Skype. We made plans several times to meet at events, but life would happen and it never worked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spoke to him one night via Facebook Messenger while I lay in bed.

But like the uniqueness of our time spent together, the grieving process that I experienced was also one that I was not accustomed to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a species, we understand death despite its heart-wrenching effects &#8211; the person you&#8217;ve come to love and care deeply about is now gone from your life, leaving a void as big as the space they created.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The\u00a0loss of online friends, however, is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anomalous in how after the passing, we are haunted by their online digital footprint.

But the knowledge that your online friends are no longer behind those accounts lodges itself in the gut, weighing us down despite looking right at their profile photo and seeing no on-screen difference than when they were alive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s difficult to navigate the rocky waters of losing our online friends &#8211; someone you care for, yet never met. Hopefully, you can turn to the community to see if other people are grieving with you, but often times this is a lonely undertaking. Turning to people in your daily routine for condolences is usually not a fruitful experience; it can often be unintentionally patronizing or dismissive because this kind of loss does not compute with them. This dismissive solace can be polarizing, but you are never alone. A loss is a loss, and your feelings of grief are valid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While everyone grieves differently, there are a lot of therapeutic ways to displace these feelings in a positive way:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send flowers and\/or condolences to the family if that&#8217;s an option. Let them know they were cared about in a community beyond their knowledge.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stream in their honor. If you have a game together, it&#8217;s nice to rinse through your feelings by revisiting those memories. If they had a game they were looking forward to, stream that.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adopt their gamer tag for characters in future games to aid their online legacy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participate in a charity in their honor. Depending on how our person has passed, there is likely a charity for it. Suicide Prevention, Cancer, Drug Abuse, Accidents, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raise money towards the greater good in their name, whether this is via crowdfunding, an event or streaming.

You don&#8217;t have to be a writer to write. If you don\u2019t write often, I feel this exercise is hugely beneficial, in fact. Write an article, write in a journal, write a letter directly to them. The brain goes into a different mode when writing, working certain areas often not triggered during any other task. Writing helps elicit not only creative thought but emotional response, allowing writing to be a hugely cathartic tool while grieving.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grief Forums.

Now, if this were the Olympics, that placing would mean lifelong crippling disappointment.

Only those three series have outsold Call of Duty in all of gaming history. And each is significantly older than CoD &#8212; Tetris and Mario by almost two decades \u2013giving them many more years to earn over Call of Duty sales.<\/p>\n<p>For more context, CoD has outsold Final Fantasy, The Sims, Grand Theft Auto, and Need for Speed by wide margins. And those are all top 10 franchises in their own right; megahits like Sonic, Halo, and Madden don\u2019t even make that list.<\/p>\n<p>The raw numbers are where this really gets fun. Since 2003, Call of Duty sales total roughly 250 million units. That\u2019s one copy for every twenty-eight people on Earth. If every one of those people played for just ten hours (which is an absurdly conservative estimate), the world has logged over 285,000 years on CoD.

If you <a href=\"http:\/\/moneynation.com\/how-much-money-has-every-call-of-duty-game-made\/\">total up the revenue<\/a> from every CoD game, you land right around 9.7 billion dollars &#8212; or with the zeroes included, which is always more impressive, $9,700,000,000. And if you include add-ons and expansions, that total jumps to $11 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Roll that back into the individual titles \u2013 CoD has released a new game annually like clockwork \u2013 and it\u2019s still hard to wrap your head around the numbers. By the end of 2015, five individual titles had broken the $1 billion mark, and it\u2019s believed that the latest installment, Black Ops 3, has passed that threshold since.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear whether Black Ops 3 has become the best-selling single title in the franchise (up-to-date numbers aren\u2019t available, but 2011\u2019s Modern Warfare 3 is listed at $1.22 billion). It was, however, certainly trending that way from day one: the games 24-hour sales numbers hit $400 million. In one day, CoD generated revenue that outpaced the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal\">annual GDP<\/a> of 10 Pacific Island nations.<\/p>\n<p>Or you can compare that number to a parallel entertainment venture: movies. The largest 24-hour box office take for a film was Star Wars: The Force Awakens, at a measly 120 million, only 30% of Black Ops 3 taking. And if you look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-numbers.com\/movie\/records\/worldwide\/2016\">total box office sales<\/a>, Modern Warfare 3 beat every single movie of 2016. That&#8217;s right &#8211; even Deadpool, Batman vs. Superman, The Jungle Book, Zootopia, and Captain America: Civil War didn&#8217;t sell as much..<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9648\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9648 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers-960x513.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America Civil War Ironman 2016 Tony Stark Call of duty sales\" width=\"768\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers-960x513.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers-320x171.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers-768x410.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers-640x342.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Captain-America-Civil-War-Iron-Man-vs-Steve-Rogers.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Honestly they&#8217;re just fighting for the scraps at this point.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>All this is to say, Call of Duty is big business.

I&#8217;m a horrific (read: hilarious) killer &#8211; I&#8217;m scared for the victims, so I don&#8217;t actually want to catch them; ironic, because whenever I play as a survivor I instinctively look to taunt the killer. What I think Dead by Daylight does best, however, is actually the Bloodweb &#8211; their leveling up tree. It\u2019s strange because I don\u2019t normally fuss over customizations or upgrades. I think it\u2019s the fact that the survivors are so similar to a Depraved from Dark Souls that I obsess over whatever advantages the Bloodweb will grant me. Considering the fact that survivors die repeatedly, perhaps there are more similarities than previously thought.<\/p>\n<p>With the second chapter comes new characters and new perks. Perks are pretty necessary and, if you&#8217;re playing as a survivor, they will save your life from time to time. The nature of the relationship between killer and survivor draw out the perks. For example, when survivor Laurie Strode uses \u201cDecisive Strike\u201d, she fends off the Killer. To add to the creepy atmosphere, the perks read like a director&#8217;s commentary from the 1978 film. It also helps that the new map is a recreation of that spooky neighborhood set in Haddonfield, NJ. Strangely enough, I\u2019ve seen that house on a Hollywood tour many years ago. Go figure.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9641\" style=\"width: 667px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_4-1.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9641\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_4-1.png\" alt=\"Halloween 2016 Michael Myers\" width=\"657\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_4-1.png 657w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_4-1-320x181.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_4-1-640x361.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I\u2019ve never been one for costumes but boy let me tell you do I love candy.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This game also boasts something that other indie titles often struggle to offer &#8211; replayability.

He didn&#8217;t let things like pettiness, anger, and contempt cloud his judgement because he didn&#8217;t have those feelings. He just operated on logic because that&#8217;s what computers do. And if there&#8217;s anything we need right now, it&#8217;s logic &#8211; something machines have in droves and the current presidential elections\u00a0definitely lack.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, it&#8217;s not like he got us into the mess of nuclear fallout in the first place, and he did his best to clean up the country\u00a0after\u00a0President Dick Richardson&#8217;s meltdown in Fallout 2.

Sure, between punching random congressmen and getting the entire Earth blown up they certainly don&#8217;t seem that way, but the boss did rip the evil alien overlord Zinyak&#8217;s head off his body with the spine intact, so that&#8230;that kind of wins the most boss-ass president award right there. Plus the boss single-handedly defused a live missile and then gained the ability to fly, time-travel, and use a dubstep gun, soooo&#8230;yeah. #Boss2016<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4.

There probably wouldn&#8217;t be any wars because cats just sleep all day. Cats don&#8217;t know what to do with money because they don&#8217;t understand the human economy, so they wouldn&#8217;t embezzle anything. Everyone will watch their speeches since they&#8217;d be cat videos. Also, they&#8217;re cute. So there&#8217;s that.<\/p>\n<p>Only drawback we can see is that they might claw the furniture or pee around the White House when they feel slightly threatened.

And that totally was a thing that happened &#8211; according to the game at least.

To the Moon<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sqkJuSV-23U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It won damn near every award given to indie games in 2011, and yet, as one reviewer put it, \u201cHow do I explain why it\u2019s brilliant without spoiling what makes it so?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this world, doctors have the power to alter memories for dying people so they can pass without regrets. Two doctors are tasked with fulfilling a man\u2019s request to \u2018remember\u2019 visiting the moon, but to do this, they have to pour through all the real (and often tragic) memories of his life. And thus unfolds one of the most beloved, thoughtful stories in gaming history. Truly a unique experience that will definitely stick with you for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s not much traditional \u2018gameplay\u2019, but to use the clich\u00e9 &#8211; you\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, and you\u2019ll walk away at the end with a moved heart \u2013 before one final twist.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>2.

Some claimed the graphics weren\u2019t up to par and that the gameplay wasn\u2019t as strong as it should have been, but it&#8217;s beloved by quite a few for all the right reasons.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s made it stand the test of time, more so than most other RPGs, is the storytelling. Your overarching goal is to save your dying daughter, which is grim enough. But many love this game for the way every momentary triumph is immediately trumped by more tragedy, and the mastery with which the developers get you invested in the characters. Prepare to have your heartstrings pulled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>3. Mother 3<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sScHQrPJ4FU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This Japanese bestseller was a marked turn from its two prequels. While thought provoking, the first two were better known for their humor; the third went a different, grimmer direction.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game opens with the death of your character\u2019s wife, and without giving anything away, she\u2019s not going to be the only one. But other characters will make you legitimately angry \u2013 a monkey that\u2019s electrocuted and threatened with his girlfriends death? A father constantly calling his son a moron? And none of this is to mention the more subtle social commentary that runs throughout. The cartoonish graphics do little to convince anyone this game is for children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><em>4. One Chance<\/em> (WARNING: video contains spoilers!)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/z9zUbpU2dJo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The name of the game is literal: you can only play it once. Try to reload it in your browser and you\u2019ll simply be dropped back off at whatever ending you\u2019ve already accomplished.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which thematically matches the plot: you\u2019re the scientist who just accidentally released a \u2018cure for cancer\u2019 that is instead wiping out the world\u2019s population in just six days time. The question is, what do you do with your final days on Earth?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And with only \u2018One Chance\u2019 to play, the emotional weight of your often-brutal decisions stick with you in a way no other game can achieve. Talk about taking dark video games to the extreme!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;if you only had one chance, what would you do?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><em>5. Bioshock: Infinite<\/em><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/31-NAkq8YEY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Probably the most successful title on this list (in America, anyway), and I don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s played it through has any illusions about this being a chipper, happy experience.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story opens without giving you much information, save that your mercenary-type character must capture a strange girl in a floating city to \u2018wipe away the debt\u2019. The next dozen or so hours of gameplay slowly unfold a story that will by turns make you sad, mad, and confused, and just when you think you\u2019ve got a handle on where the ending\u2019s headed, it throws you for three more loops. The word \u2018betrayal\u2019 comes to mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you one of the few people who haven&#8217;t played this game yet? You want a popular title that\u2019ll legitimately give you the feels? Here it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong><em>6.

A survival horror game featuring uncountable monsters trying to kill you? That\u2019s a horror thriller, and while they\u2019re awesome in their own right, they\u2019re not the kind of \u2018dark\u2019 we\u2019re talking about here.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Except this one is. The second Silent Hill is revered not for it\u2019s excellent gameplay or stunning graphics \u2013 gamers remember it for the storytelling. Your character receives a letter from his dead wife that lures him to a strange, hellish town. But the subtle way the plot unfolds, and how you learn the twisted backstories explaining exactly what\u2019s happened to all the characters you\u2019re encountering (including yourself) make this one of the greatest dark video games ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>7.

That argument is pretty valid with most Zelda titles.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not Majora\u2019s Mask. It starts off sad \u2013 Link lost and depressed in a new land \u2013 and it only gets darker from there. From the stories of the people he encounters to a truly heartbreaking ending, it\u2019s like nothing else in the Zelda series. Which makes the entire experience even more powerful. Try to play this one without feeling lost, lonely, and miserable yourself. If you are able to, you may not have a soul and you might want to get that checked out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>8. Sad Satan<\/strong><\/em><\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tJ6zHUyp_V8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In a meta sense, this \u2018game\u2019 is even creepier because no one\u2019s totally sure what it is:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Someone uploaded a video of themselves doing a play-through to Youtube (above) claiming they found the game on the deep web. In it, the player walks down black and white hallways while listening to garbled audio tracks like Charles Manson interviews and Hitler\u2019s speeches. Occasionally, an image will pop up blocking your way, often depicting murders. The only other characters are terrifying little children that don\u2019t interact with you at all \u2013 until the end, where one kills you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the really fun bit: no one\u2019s sure who made this, where it came from, or what the goal is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s nothing the internet likes more than a mystery, so speculation and research into just WTF this thing was exploded last year. If you want to go down the rabbit hole, <a href=\"http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/sadsatan\">this dedicated subreddit<\/a>\u00a0has plenty to keep you busy for a few days. We can say with confidence that this is one of those dark video games you&#8217;ll want to play with the lights on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>9.

I\u2019m excited for you right now. Because you\u2019re about to go on a wild ride reading this completely accurate description of the premise:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sadistic teddy bear locks you in a school with 14 other students, one of whom you must murder without getting caught. Only if you pull this off may you leave the school \u2013 but when you do, the teddy bear executes all the remaining kids. Or you can get it wrong and you&#8217;ll also die. So basically, you die or you die, and you die by homicidal psycho teddy bear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need we say more?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><em><strong>10.

They can&#8217;t help it &#8211; they&#8217;re just following trends in the gaming community. So it should go without saying that Spec Ops should be the same, right?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not even close. The campaign\u2019s story and stomaching what your character must do is emotionally difficult to handle. Instead of glorifying combat, Spec Ops makes you realize just how disastrous it really is for everyone involved \u2013 which, by the end of the game, will include you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our list was pretty comprehensive, but obviously we didn&#8217;t include them all.

It\u2019s not only an amazing party game but one of the most hilarious applications of VR to date (not that you have to play it in virtual reality, but it helps up the ante), Keep Talking debuted on the Gear VR back in July of 2015 with staggered releases on Windows (Rift and Vive optional), Mac OS, and, most recently, the Playstation VR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tQosnomNFak?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel Crate Games is the brilliant studio behind Keep Talking, unleashing what started as an entry in the Global Game Jam of 2014 unto the world, Ottawa based developers Ben, Allen and Brian joined forces and made the first version of the game in 48 hours to immediate critical acclaim.

Player 2 reads from the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bombmanual.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manual<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing the necessary information for the bomb handler to succeed. While it sounds simple, there seems to be an infinite number of obstacles to go along with the convoluted directions Player 2 must decipher just to give Player 1 a chance; and oh yeah &#8211; there\u2019s an incessant alarm that rings true right when you get in the groove of things which the player is responsible for turning off&#8230;or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9607\" style=\"width: 659px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_3-1.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9607\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_3-1.png\" alt=\"Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes VR Indie Game\" width=\"649\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_3-1.png 649w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_3-1-320x213.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_3-1-640x427.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Uhh&#8230;maybe I&#8217;m not qualified for this&#8230;<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can\u2019t imagine having to listen to more than one person attempt to direct me through the defusal.

It also brought VR vs AR to the forefront, with Pokemon Go being a thing and companies finally bringing virtual reality to the masses. With a slew of options hitting the market concurrently, most notably Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear, and HTC Vive, consumers finally have affordable options for experiencing next-level immersion gaming like never before. And while sales haven\u2019t met the market\u2019s expectations out the gate, VR is still expected to be a $21 billion industry by 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether game developers would prefer to sit out this new era is irrelevant \u2013 a pile of money that huge demands attention from the industry. And some of the most interesting early action is coming from the folks who make a living by crafting nightmares. This\u00a0bodes well for consumers, because we oddly seem to enjoy living them through our device screens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems most companies in the VR vs AR debate have sided with the former, if only because the technology is easier for customers to understand. On paper, horror gaming and virtual reality is a match made in heaven. The genre makes a living on Psychology and getting inside a player\u2019s head. While all games can achieve new levels of immersion with VR, perhaps no other category lives and dies by its ability to put a gamer \u2018in the room\u2019, truly feeling the emotions their avatar must be experiencing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is already old news. Most of the viral VR demos in the past year have been horror games. The reason is obvious: a cute girl wearing a Vive saying \u2018Ooooh\u2019 while playing virtual golf is twenty thousand times less entertaining than the same girl screaming \u2018AHHHHH MOTHER F*CKER!!!\u2019 when a demon charges her in an abandoned basement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Qsna1ChGt0E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, the scares have graduated above demos. The biggest horror franchise to embrace VR is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-08-03\/virtual-reality-horror-game-tests-limits-of-technology-nausea\">Resident Evil<\/a>, Capcom\u2019s eternal cash cow. Say what you want about the movies, but those films have grossed $900 million internationally, and the series has sold upwards of 69 million games since 1996. If a major developer staking their largest franchise on virtual reality doesn\u2019t convince you VR is here to stay, nothing will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cVR is a perfect match for a horror game,\u201d says Jun Takeuchi, a corporate developer for Resident Evil 7. \u201cA player screaming out in terror is the sweetest music to our ears.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, early testers of RE7 have done less screaming and more vomiting. Reviews have been aggressively negative of Capcom\u2019s ability to keep players from losing their lunch, especially following a July gaming Expo. Kotaku won the headline wars: \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/kotaku.com\/resident-evil-7-in-vr-is-a-nauseating-mess-1782288909\">Resident Evil 7 in VR is a Nauseating Mess<\/a>.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game doesn\u2019t release until 2017, theoretically giving Takeuchi and Co. plenty of time to iron out the bugs. The question is, will they be able to?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR sickness isn\u2019t a problem unique to RE7, even if it sounds like Capcom requires more puke buckets than most. Despite the hype train\u2019s claims of total immersion, a combination of factors regularly makes VR players feel ill during games. The motion you \u2018see\u2019 in a headset versus what your brain expects to see when you\u2019re \u2018running\u2019 is the usual suspect. Developers haven\u2019t yet conquered the obstacle of a first-person avatar running full sprint while looking hard right. And besides, how immersive is Rift if everything looks fantastic, but you cognitively understand you\u2019re sitting on a dirty futon in your dorm room the entire time?<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9535\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9535 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1-960x770.jpeg\" alt=\"Ole Miss Dorm Room gorgeous girls room lucky vr vs ar\" width=\"768\" height=\"616\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1.jpeg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1-320x257.jpeg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1-768x616.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/1471463643-unknown-1-640x513.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">God, what a dump.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That last bit is why not everyone\u2019s buying VR as the end-all-be-all of horror gaming. VR vs AR is\u00a0warming up\u00a0for the long haul.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re already familiar with augmented reality, even if you haven\u2019t heard the term. A certain mobile game that shall go unnamed \u2013 it rhymes with Shmokemon Joe \u2013 features digital characters overlaid into the real world. Players explore actual places in the real universe that are simply enhanced by digital technology. That formula became a worldwide phenomenon, <a href=\"https:\/\/gamerant.com\/pokemon-go-sales-200-million\/\">earning $200 million in a single month<\/a> and spawning <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pornhub.com\/view_video.php?viewkey=ph57a3768e5f23c\">several porn spin-offs<\/a>. All of this\u00a0accomplished with AR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VOID, or Vision of Infinite Dimensions, wants to build on that concept. The <a href=\"https:\/\/thevoid.com\/Press\">press release<\/a> describes the platform as, \u201cleading the world in a new form of immersive entertainment. A combination of a physical set, real-time interactive effects and virtual reality are utilized to create powerful <a href=\"https:\/\/trademarks.justia.com\/869\/68\/hypr-86968317.html\">HYPR REALITY<\/a> experiences that meld digital and physical worlds together.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that\u2019s just a lot of fancy marketing words, when really, if you watch this video, the only description you need is \u2018amazeballs\u2019:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cML814JD09g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Did you watch it? Good. You see what they\u2019ve done. \u2018Immersion\u2019 can be a difficult concept for a game, horror or otherwise, to achieve while your sitting on your dad\u2019s La-Z-Boy. Instead, these evil geniuses give you a simple real-world environment to run around in, and overlay it with digital assets. What\u2019s more, all this actual human movement reportedly eliminates much of the VR nausea RE7 is now notorious for.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, imagine you turn a blind corner in a game, and the chick from \u2018The Ring\u2019 is staring you down. At home wearing a Vive, you shout, maybe jump in your seat left a few inches, then slam the joysticks backwards as fast as possible. In the future as conceived by VOID, you\u2019ll legitimately have to sprint backwards while dodging poisonous mist fired from real jets hidden in the walls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which sounds more immersive to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9536\" style=\"width: 765px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_16.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-9536 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_16.png\" alt=\"Wikihow adult diapers vr vs ar\" width=\"755\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_16.png 755w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_16-320x230.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_16-640x460.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Either way, you&#8217;ll probably need adult diapers.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of this is to say one platform will clearly\u00a0dominate the horror gaming market of the future. VOID\u2019s concept isn\u2019t yet open to the public \u2013 they\u2019re hoping to open just a few locations in early 2017. Home VR has obvious accessibility advantages. But when it comes to an \u2018experience\u2019, it\u2019s hard to argue with that AR promo video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So who won the VR vs AR war? Will the conflict ever end? What will resolve this battle?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps then, the split will look something like the equilibrium struck by paintball and Call of Duty.

Workinman is a web and mobile app company based in our home state of New York. After two years of polish post game-jam, Workinman released Deathstate to rave reviews in 2015. Even though Workinman was founded in 2006, Deathstate is the studio\u2019s first major independent release. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s one of those games that&#8217;s easy to pick up yet difficult game to master. The learning curve is such that if you don\u2019t utilize the right balance of weapons, items and spells within half an hour of starting, you probably won\u2019t survive another 15 minutes. Your character is drawn to the biggest enemy on screen, all the while being surrounded by ghouls, goblins, and ghosts in horrifyingly huge numbers. The challenge, and subsequent torment, are ingratiating nonetheless. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9516\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Deathstate6.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-9516\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Deathstate6.png\" alt=\"Deathstate reviews steam indie game video games Cthulhu 2016 presidential elections\" width=\"900\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Deathstate6.png 699w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Deathstate6-320x155.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Deathstate6-640x310.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cthulhu is indeed running for president.

It was a combination of the retro lights blasting from the Deathstate demo and the way he led me to their booth with the power of his personality from 100 yards away. In addition to his role at Workinman, he also makes comics and games as Imaginary Monsters. He\u2019s making his own titles using Gamemaker.

Cindy. Yes, we have the weirdest boner right now.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Perhaps the most consistent complaint that is echoed throughout the entirety of the internet, however, is that Final Fantasy games are becoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=final%20fantasy%20becoming%20linear\">increasingly more restricted<\/a>. Freedom finds itself limited as players are often unable to utilize an overworld map. Another qualm comes from the lack of an airship early in the game, limiting travel to a straight line. When freedom is diminished, exploration grinds to a halt.\u00a0All at once, the gamers cry &#8220;this game is far too linear&#8221;!<\/p>\n<p>This was never more apparent than when Final Fantasy X was released. In the tenth installment, players assume the role of Tidus, a young Blitzball player from Zanarkand, who has washed ashore on the strange island of Besaid. Since he has nowhere to go, he decides to join a novice summoner named Yuna on her religious pilgrimage. Their journey takes them from one end of Spira to the other as they collect powerful aeons to destroy the great evil known as Sin. As this is a pilgrimage, players are restricted from jumping around the continent all willy-nilly and must adhere to the plan that has been laid out for them. Since there&#8217;s no immediate access to an airship and all traversing is done on foot, this absolute straight-line sojourning makes the game the very definition of a linear RPG.<\/p>\n<p>This didn&#8217;t sit well with many players, who had, only a few years prior, played the extremely free-roaming Final Fantasy VII &#8211; many of whom <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgamer.net\/articles\/why-final-fantasy-vii-still-resonates-after-all-these-years\">cannot find much, if any, fault with<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;if Final Fantasy VII, the airship-loving, overworld-map-having fan favorite, is the supposed gold standard of Final Fantasy games, what saving grace does Final Fantasy X and other linear RPGs like it have?<\/p>\n<p>Could it be&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bXZhTb0eUqA?start=112&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Nah, just kidding.<\/p>\n<p>The answer lies in its problem: <strong>linearity, its greatest weakness, is also its greatest strength<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that chilling Joker quote from The Dark Knight?<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Nobody panics when things go &#8220;according to plan.&#8221; Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it&#8217;s all &#8220;part of the plan&#8221;. Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although\u00a0the Joker was a fictional psychopath, he was a fictional psychopath with truth in his words. People make plans. They execute those plans. They follow those plans. And if something happens to cause a slight deviation, they try to get back to following the plans. In those moments where they&#8217;ve lost their way, there&#8217;s potential for confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness. Why? Because things didn&#8217;t go according to plan.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9487\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/giphy.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-9487\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Joker Explosion Gif The Dark Knight Heath Ledger 2008\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Where&#8217;s my explosions?

After a brief indoctrination, they learned why she was on this important and sacred journey. Everyone understood\u00a0that this plan, no matter how difficult or how inconsequential it seemed, must be fully executed. This was the entire purpose of this game.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a devastating blow\u00a0when the truth behind Yuna&#8217;s pilgrimage was slowly but surely revealed to be not only fatal, but inherently flawed. Eventually, the plan, once unquestioningly followed by summoner after summoner, found itself\u00a0discarded. The group became\u00a0depressed and in despair but remained determined to defeat Sin at any cost. In the end, they took on the true evil behind Sin. They did this without a plan, somehow bringing peace to all of Spira.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9488\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-9488\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original-960x540.jpg\" alt=\"Final Fantasy X-2 FFX2 Yuna Rikku Paine\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original-960x540.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original-320x180.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original-640x360.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/original.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8230;until the shitty girl power sequel that practically undid everything the first title explained, that is.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>When I first played this game, I fell into the trap it had laid out for players. I wanted things to go to plan. I wanted to move fluidly from one town to the next. But when that plan fell to pieces, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. I yearned for the plan and bemoaned any unnecessary deviations from the charted course. I just wanted what was once considered safe and comfortable back again. It didn&#8217;t matter if there were terrible consequences; at least I could predict what would happen. A plan was safe; the unknown was not.<\/p>\n<p>And it was in that moment of anxiety that I realized how much I valued the linear gameplay. It dawned on me how it had enhanced the overall storyline. I wasn&#8217;t travelling\u00a0to a random location because &lt;insert reason here&gt;; rather, I had a logical progression ahead of me. What logical progression, you may ask? Why, the logical progression drilled into my head for the previous 20 hours. Instead of moving from one arbitrary location to the next, towns completely interchangeable with each other, I clung fervently to\u00a0the straight and narrow even though\u00a0life as Tidus&amp;Co. knew it was desperately trying to throw them off the trail.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that all games that feature absolute freedom have terrible storylines, but it does make for a different experience. After playing several years of Skyrim, the storyline has become far too muddled for me to remember everything all my characters have done. I mostly just remember actively avoiding the main questline entirely. I thoroughly enjoy Skyrim, but I don&#8217;t play it for the story at all. This truth goes for all the sandbox RPGs in my library.

And with the advent of these advanced, gorgeous, immersive and wildly popular adventure titles, the gaming world moved on from little old Runescape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or did it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15 years after its release, Runescape just landed at number 9 on the list of <a href=\"http:\/\/igcritic.com\/most-played-mmorpg-games-of-2016\/\">2016\u2019s Most Played MMORPGs<\/a> worldwide.

Even if you have moved on to bigger and better things, Runescape is still a juggernaut in online gaming, trucking along with an average of 50,000+ players logged on at any given time. And this for a game that\u2019s only marginally evolved over the past decade and a half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps that\u2019s not fair. As mentioned, Runescape holds the world title for being the most updated MMO. This feat doesn\u2019t even seem like it should be trackable. But take a quick scroll through the website\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/services.runescape.com\/m=news\/\">News<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/services.runescape.com\/m=forum\/forums.ws?jptg=ia&amp;jptv=navbar\">Forum<\/a> pages and you\u2019ll see that Jagex is constantly dumping in more and more for its players to build, explore, and conquer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet the basic tenants remain. The game\u2019s most constant criticism is \u2018the grind\u2019 \u2013 you\u2019re essentially leveling up skills by clicking trees and stoves and dragons on repeat. And while that\u2019s true of most MMOs, there are few games out there that support the huge number of disparate skills available in Runescape. How many other games boast such boring yet necessary abilities as woodcutting, cooking, and mining?<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9477\" style=\"width: 517px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_30.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9477\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_30.png\" alt=\"Runescape Cooking Level 99 Old School Nostalgia\" width=\"507\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_30.png 507w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_30-320x203.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Time well spent.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there\u2019s gameplay and interface. Point-and-click is a genre with uncountable diehard fans, but these days, when you\u2019re exploring digital worlds, you\u2019re typically treated to silky smooth graphics and beautifully rendered landscapes. Runescape has released major overhauls of their graphic engine, most notably in 2007 and 2013. Unfortunately, it\u2019s still extremely shit, especially next to what gamers are used to in 2016.\u00a0And I mean that in the most loving way possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YaxYxQtIyvU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see what I\u2019m getting at. I can\u2019t imagine being 13-years old today, with my eyeballs used to the high-octane action of Call of Duty and the porn-worthy graphics of Final Fantasy, and deciding that I\u2019d rather spend hours leveling up an F2P character by starting pointless fires in a childishly rendered environment. So then, how do you explain Runescape\u2019s continued popularity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who\u2019s played an MMO is aware of the tragically addicting nature of the games. Open-ended virtual worlds provide almost endless possibilities for progress. It doesn&#8217;t matter if\u00a0acknowledge you\u2019re ignoring leveling up in \u2018real life\u2019. The sense of achievement when you unlock that next level after hours of grinding is undeniable. Thus, successful MMOs have more staying power than linear games.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially true once you\u2019ve already sunk a huge number of hours into a title, which makes the nostalgia factor more than a sentimental connection \u2013 it\u2019s a very real driver of staying power. Unlike FPS or linear adventure games, you\u2019re less likely to bounce between half a dozen MMOs at once because you want to dedicate your gaming hours to upgrading one character as huge as possible. And as the first great fantasy MMO, Runescape was the market\u2019s first mover, grabbing gamers well before the days of WoW and the rest. And ever since, even if you\u2019ve personally moved on, Jagex\u2019s constant updates guarantee the die-hards always have something new to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9478\" style=\"width: 515px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_31.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9478\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_31.png\" alt=\"Runescape Level 99 Firemaking Skill tree achievement\" width=\"505\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_31.png 505w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_31-320x207.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Awesome, now onto vacuuming and goat herding grinding!<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But at the foundation of both these points is what made Runescape popular back in the day. To this day,\u00a0it maintains what others cannot: accessibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, there are other free-to-play MMORPGs that anyone can explore with minimal effort and financial commitment. But aside from simply being first, Runescape\u2019s browser play makes it available to a group of would-be heroes many first world gamers forget about. Not everyone\u2019s running state of the art graphic cards or surfing with ultra-high speed fiber-optic connections. Not everyone\u2019s turned off by simpler art designs. As long as it runs smoothly, it still satisfies that bone-deep need for adventure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At age 13, I spent hours sitting in my family\u2019s basement with the lights out on an already obsolete Dell. Armed with the most craptastic of internet connections, I could run Runescape perfectly fine. I didn\u2019t have to download anything my parents would be mad about. I didn\u2019t have to ask for a credit card. Shit, I didn\u2019t even have to admit I was playing an MMORPG. And for these reasons, it was my first gaming love. It hooked me for far more many years than I\u2019d care to admit.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9479\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/kid-hands-on-computer.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9479\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/kid-hands-on-computer.jpg\" alt=\"Kid typing on computer\" width=\"630\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/kid-hands-on-computer.jpg 630w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/kid-hands-on-computer-320x178.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plus Runescape taught us all how to type and you&#8217;re lying if you say otherwise.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internet is universally faster these days. Spending a frankly obscene number of hours leveling up an avatar is much more societally acceptable than it once was. But for a segment of younger, teenage players, I\u2019d wager Runescape\u2019s unprecedented accessibility is still a massive turn on. And even if they don\u2019t discover for themselves, they have my generation to point them in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Never miss another article \u2013 like us on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/equityarcade\/\">FaceBook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EquityArcade\">Twitter<\/a>.

Founded in 2012, they worked on Solace, The Fourth Wall and Nitronic Rush. Refract\u2019s debut title, Distance, is the spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush and is currently available on <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233610\">Steam\u2019s early access<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/57AFXGzrhrs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Distance successfully raised not quite $162,000 on Kickstarter back at the end of 2012. Refract has been thorough in their development. A Greenlight campaign as well as a planned alpha and beta proceeded the early access version that launched at the end of 2014. I had the chance to express my love of Distance to a studio member at PAX West 2016 &#8211; I guess you can say I have been eagerly awaiting this indie gem for some time.<\/p>\n<p>What makes it different than other racing games?<\/p>\n<p>The survival theme is typically reserved for\u00a0the horror or action-adventure genre; however, Distance incorporates these mechanics seamlessly into fast-paced racing gameplay. In tandem with how enjoyably frustrating maneuvering through the gorgeous cityscape can be, there are enough lasers, buzzsaws and obstacles to make Distance a true survival racing game. There\u2019s nothing worse than watching your car get bisected like a GoW Locust while an opponent speeds past on their way to victory.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_13.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9464\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_13.png\" alt=\"Going the Distance Indie Game Steam PC Racing\" width=\"659\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_13.png 659w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_13-320x180.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_13-640x360.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just Jedi-like reflexes you need to survive in Distance; right when you think you\u2019ve run out of road, wings sprout from your car and you lift off like a Musk on his way to Mars. Like what? Talk about unique! And the newness doesn&#8217;t end there &#8211; the visuals and feel are truly remarkable. This\u00a0dark world is illuminated only by neon checkpoints and a Tron aesthetic. The linear art direction only adds to the sense of speed. Couple that with a Deadmau5-esque score at 180bpm and your heart will truly be pounding as you white-knuckle your controller. It&#8217;s truly the feel of the game that sets it apart from the rest.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always loved cars, as I grew up on a dealership lot, and I\u2019ve always loved racing games. My first time was with Gran Turismo on the PlayStation. I enjoyed tinkering in Need for Speed Underground on the PS2. I grew to love the supercars in Project Gotham Racing 3 on the Xbox 360. With this genuine love and experience I have with this genre, I argue that it\u2019s the survival nature of Distance that puts it in a league of its own. Countless gameplay modes make it enticing, be it competing online, on the couch with a friend or even by yourself trying to beat your best time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_14.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9465\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_14.png\" alt=\"Going the Distance Indie Game Steam PC Racing Game\" width=\"662\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_14.png 662w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_14-320x179.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Screenshot_14-640x358.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Refract&#8217;s grand design\u00a0ensures that Distance\u2019s full release is\u00a0packed to the roof with content.

Odds are, if you\u2019re not glued to the TV every Sunday watching football while incessantly refreshing fantasy scores, you\u2019ve dated someone who does. And you\u2019re not alone &#8212; in 2015, single NFL games were <a href=\"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2015\/11\/nfl-tv-ratings-rankings-no-1-show-snf-mnf-local-markets\">45 of the top 50 most watched shows<\/a> on cable television, averaging nearly double the viewership of primetime network slots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertisers know this, which is why NFL commercials cost the GDP of small nations. Last season, a thirty-second spot during a nationally televised game <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/media\/nfl-staggering-ad-prices-2015-16-season\/300376\/\">cost near-as-makes-no-difference $500,000<\/a>, and primetime games on Sunday and Monday nights can run even higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tell you all this so you appreciate how huge Gears of War 4 just went to air this 2-minute launch trailer smack in the middle of Monday Night Football:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ji2aU4EdQww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember puberty? When your hormones finally kicked in, and all of a\u00a0sudden you start having confusing, tingly feelings that you\u2019d never experienced before? That\u2019s how Gears of War trailers affect many people: you don\u2019t fully understand why, but even though you\u2019re watching OTT grotesque monster gore, you have the #feels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, before dissenters angrily type\u00a0long-winded comments, obviously no commercial is universally popular. You don\u2019t have to like this trailer; maybe this isn\u2019t your cup of Earl Grey. But the fact is, Gears of War is Xbox\u2019s second-most successful franchise, only behind Halo in total sales. And you don\u2019t put up those kind of numbers unless your marketing team is doing something right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The formula isn\u2019t new. The ad men struck gold with the first Gears of War trailer back in 2006, and haven\u2019t tweaked the recipe since. This ought to look familiar:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ccWrbGEFgI8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That trailer still remains one of the most adored video game ads in history. And if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it \u2013 every title in the Gears of War series features\u00a0the same formula: human soldiers on growth hormones; depressing post-apocalyptic environment; terrifying monsters and high-octane thrills. And all of that bonkers action set to a slow emotional song.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re a smart person. You can deduce why these trailers make an impression. They catch you off guard by showing you exploding heads and chainsaw bayonets, which is attention grabbing in its own right. But then, instead of back dropping that warfare with Slayer or Rise Against, they play songs usually only found on the playlists of emo teenagers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And according to Gears of War\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.vgchartz.com\/article\/250124\/gears-of-war-a-sales-history\/\">sales over the past decade<\/a>, it works. But why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per usual, science can provide the answers. We\u2019re not enthralled with these advertisements by coincidence \u2013 the boys on Madison Avenue are using tried and true psychological ploys to lock these trailers in your mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and most basically, these ads are different. Watch enough TV, and you become at least subconsciously aware of the standard formula used in every commercial. A happens then B happens then C happens, lots of pretty people smile, they flash a crowd-tested logo at the end and play some upbeat music in the background. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZdpJfnrMSeQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When an ad breaks that mold, your brain reacts. And it&#8217;s usually for the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We humans are creatures of habit, so when something new and unexpected happens, it catches us\u00a0a bit off guard. This is especially true in television. If we\u2019re vegging out in front of our flat screen, most of us are doing\u00a0as little thinking as possible. No, really &#8211; our brains <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/52959-television-cognitive-function.html\">literally shutdown<\/a> while we&#8217;re in front of the TV. When something abnormal appears that you\u2019re not ready or willing to process, your brain\u2019s first reaction is \u2018what is this?\u2019 and your curiosity is piqued.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technical term for this phenomenon is \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/science-choice\/201412\/change-and-habituation\">habituation<\/a>\u2019 &#8211; essentially, we\u00a0love routines, but routines get old so we like something new every so often. Subconsciously, we want the same things over and over again, but after a while we need a shake-up to keep things interesting. Of course, going &#8220;full-tilt interesting&#8221; can certianly\u00a0backfire &#8211; that\u2019s why most advertisers stick to the tried and true and boring. To make anything else is risky, both for the product and their careers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So throwing a change-up at the masses\u2019 psyche can go horribly wrong. When it goes right \u2013 like it did for Gears or War \u2013 it\u2019s a homerun. Still though, what makes this \u2018go right\u2019?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s an element of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/basics\/cognitive-dissonance\">cognitive dissonance<\/a> at play. You&#8217;re drawn to the fact that the trailer\u2019s visuals don\u2019t match the audio. It doesn\u2019t make sense, and thus your brain\u2019s having a fundamentally foreign\u00a0reaction (per habituation) to what it\u2019s processing. But that exact reaction is what\u2019s making it memorable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there are the emotional aspects of the music. The ad shows\u00a0intense, cold-blooded sci-fi warfare \u2013 quite possibly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0the least romantic scenes imaginable. Yet instead of playing up those gory aspects with hard rock or metal tracks, the trailer adds emotional layers by dropping in a tune that you\u2019d only expect to hear during a Saturday night pity party of one.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9417\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dawson-Crying.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-9417 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dawson-Crying.gif\" alt=\"Dawson crying meme Gears of War\" width=\"480\" height=\"326\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh no, Dawson, please don&#8217;t cry&#8230;<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This manipulation, in fact, is a major gripe with many video game reviewers. Because of the unique musical choices, the trailers lead us to believe the game will feature heavy character development and complex emotional storylines. Gears of War titles do have a bit of this, but not nearly to the degree the advertisements would have you believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that was never the point. The commercial\u2019s audio tracks weren\u2019t picked as a nod to aspects of the gameplay, they were simply chosen as a clever scheme to sell product. A surprising commercial that throws off a viewer\u2019s subconscious, but makes up for and takes advantage of your brain\u2019s attention by being emotionally manipulative and undeniably cool? Slapped right in the middle of Monday Night Football?<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9416\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9416 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658.jpg\" alt=\"Family Guy Football Madden Gears of War\" width=\"800\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658.jpg 800w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658-320x220.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658-768x529.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/45055658-640x441.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you didn&#8217;t read this in his voice, you&#8217;re too young for you, bruh.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, take our money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Never miss another article \u2013 like us on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/equityarcade\/\">FaceBook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EquityArcade\">Twitter<\/a>.

On top of that, it got me thinking that maybe I could turn around and sell my device as well; since I have an android, the device <a href=\"http:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2016\/9\/16\/12945746\/pokemon-go-plus-android-issues\">barely works on my phone<\/a> anyway, so why not recoup my losses and make a few quick bucks off it at the same time?<\/p>\n<p>And it was at that moment that I realized the beautiful lesson Pokemon Go PLUS was teaching us about one of the basic rules of economics: supply and demand.<\/p>\n<p>Supply is\u00a0defined as the amount of any given product that exists, and demand is\u00a0defined as how much of the product\u00a0that people want. In this scenario, the product is the Pokemon Go PLUS, the supply is how much of the device exists, and the demand is, well, evident &#8211; people want it, and they want it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=ASAFP\">ASAFP<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/davidthier\/2016\/09\/16\/pokemon-go-plus-comes-out-today-but-theyre-very-hard-to-find\/#1a5f9837545b\">unclear how many Pokemon Go PLUS devices were made<\/a>, it&#8217;s easy to see\u00a0that the number was woefully inadequate.\u00a0Preorders sold out within the first few weeks, and at launch, the physical stores sold their stock in an instant. With no more devices in immediate production, savvy\u00a0re-sellers knew this would be an opportunity to make some cash. They bought up the devices at $35.00 and resold them at a higher cost, often doubling or tripling their profits.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9391\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9391 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee-960x636.jpg\" alt=\"Pokemon Pokecoins pikachu pokemon go pokego pogo PLUS Supply and demand\" width=\"768\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee-960x636.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee-320x212.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee-768x508.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/free-pokecoins-wee-640x424.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This image was titled &#8220;free pokecoins wee&#8221; and we thought you all should know that.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Instead of turning up their noses at the exorbitant cost, some trainers have been snapping up the devices regardless of\u00a0the increased pricetag, The price is key to understanding the relationship between supply and demand. If supply is low and demand is high, this law dictates that price will go up. The scarcity of the object coupled with its desirability gives it an inflated perceived value, and people will still be willing to pay above retail price if they want it badly enough.<\/p>\n<p>The law of supply and demand dictates that the inverse is also true &#8211; if the demand is low but the supply is high, the price will inevitably go down. This is probably what Niantic feared\u00a0when they went to production with the Pokemon Go PLUS; instead of confidently making a lot of devices, they made a\u00a0small\u00a0amount to &#8220;test the waters&#8221;, so to speak. Should the product have been a total flop, the large quantity of unsold PLUS devices would sit around in warehouses collecting dust. They&#8217;d liquidate at a reduced price and lose money in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>By making a limited amount of gadgets, Niantic was able to safely make some money. Judging by the reaction to the device, they certainly could have made more to increase profits. They must have believed that the risk was not worth taking, no matter how big the potential reward could be. This limited supply with the added intense demand drove the price unreasonably high. The value is currently set at whatever a trainer is willing to pay for it; at the moment, that appears to be around $100.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9392\" style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/pikachu-it-prints-money.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9392 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/pikachu-it-prints-money.jpg\" alt=\"pikachu money bling chain glasses pokemon pokemon go plus pokemon go supply and demand\" width=\"730\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/pikachu-it-prints-money.jpg 730w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/pikachu-it-prints-money-320x179.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/pikachu-it-prints-money-640x359.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>If Pokemon Go has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that a week or two will pass and the Pokemon Go PLUS craze, much like the game itself, will fade. Resellers that haven&#8217;t sold their gadgets at the increased price will have to\u00a0make a hard choice. Either stubbornly stick to three figures or will lower it down to something more reasonable. The latter would probably be enough to make a profit, certainly, but not the crazy gains they&#8217;d hoped for. This is because demand for the product has decreased, despite the supply remaining a constant. Simple supply and demand, right?<\/p>\n<p>Good news for those trainers that have yet to get their hands on a device.

I interviewed\u00a0two Asian-American actors well-versed in these issues;\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0947172\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelvin Han Yee<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a veteran in the Asian-American acting community (both on stage and on screen) and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm6764449\/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courtney Kurata<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an actress still trying to find her way in the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked what Whitewashing meant to them, they responded similarly. \u201cThe term \u2018whitewashing\u2019 to me means taking something from an ethnic background or non-Western culture, and taking and changing it to please and appeal to the general Western or White masses\u201d, said Kurata. Yee agreed, noting that there is a distinction between Whitewashing and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1IHRVdRV4Ys\">Yellowface<\/a>.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Yellowface is the practice of putting on makeup to change the appearance of a White person to be Asian. Both, he says, are harmful and should discontinue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how it affected their careers, they again spoke similarly about their limitations they faced due to their race. \u201cI have not had the opportunities that my White peers have had to develop themselves as artists. I began in theater. My White peers would set goals like \u2018I\u2019m gonna be Romeo or Hamlet before I\u2019m 30\u2019. And those goals were achievable for them. At this stage in my career, I should be playing weighty parts like \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Macbeth\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Scottish King<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d. I should have that available to me, but it\u2019s not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll tell you a story to illustrate the obstacles I\u2019ve had to overcome. I was the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kelvinhanyee.com\/Kelvin_Han_Yee\/WELCOME.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first Asian American actor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.osfashland.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oregon Shakespeare Festival<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Ashland in its 65 years of history. When we performed that year, the organization received letters;\u00a0<strong>people were disappointed because they \u2018planned this trip all year\u2019 only to see an Asian man on stage. They complained it was \u2018not meant to be performed that way\u2019.<\/strong> It had nothing to do with my performance &#8211; it was my race that they took issue with. And that\u2019s hard to deal with, because that can affect decisions made by casting directors; with the recent Dr. Strange casting of \u2018the Ancient One\u2019&#8230;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/movies\/article\/Marvel-s-dubious-casting-choices-7393052.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, that could have been me<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I could have auditioned for that, but <strong>it wasn\u2019t made open to Asian men<\/strong>. My career is often stunted due to Whitewashing like that, and it\u2019s hard.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9320\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9320 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1-960x540.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Strange Tilda Swinton Asian man ghost in the shell\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1-960x540.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1-320x180.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1-640x360.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/4588309-untitled-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above: A 500+ year old Asian man with magical powers who ages very, veeeeery slowly.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurata agreed. \u201cWhen it comes to my career as an actor, it\u2019s been rather difficult auditioning. This is especially true for specific Asian roles. Hollywood and the entertainment industry still wants to box Asian people into a stereotype. As a tall, curvy, Japanese American woman, I go into these auditions facing racial judgement and comments. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m too tall (I\u2019m 5\u20198) or big to be Asian. I\u2019ve been asked if I could\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca\/en\/article\/mina-shum-profile\/\">read the lines in a silly Asian accent<\/a>. A<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ny post I come across for an Asian role says they\u2019re looking for a female who can \u201cplay Asian (meaning not necessarily be Asian, but look similar), wear a size 0-4, be no taller than 5\u20194\u201d, and have straight black\/brown hair. Rarely do I ever see an Asian role as a lead. It\u2019s usually for the part of a sidekick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up, <strong>I never really had an Asian actor to look up to. It made me wish I was White so I could be on TV or in a movie; then I would feel popular or significant in some way.<\/strong> I mean, the only Asian women I saw on screen were <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tiacarrere.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tia Carrere<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0001840\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ming Na<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0005154\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucy Liu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But none of them looked like me or had anything I could relate to besides being Asian females. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m still motivated to keep pursuing this dream. There\u2019s such a lack of representation in Hollywood. Asians only represent about 1-2% of the industry, and <strong>we matter and have important stories to tell.<\/strong>\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are those that argue Asians are not American. I\u2019ve even heard it myself when I ask friends and family why they believe Asians aren\u2019t in lead roles. They usually respond with \u201cmaybe their accents will be too hard to understand\u201d. \u201cThey want an American, not an Asian\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurata believes that is absolutely preposterous. \u201cMy grandparents were actually born in California, so they were United States citizens. Because of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, they were seen as the enemy. This was solely based on the way they looked and their surname. My grandparents met and got married in internment camp during WWII. They had to prove their allegiance and assimilate to Western society and culture for many many years afterwards. Even after all this, society barely accepted them. Growing up, my family has embraced more of the Western culture. But it does NOT mean we abandoned our heritage and culture. Sometimes it was a means to survive.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9321\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/hqdefault.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9321\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber Jay Park Canadian Korean American Ghost in the Shell movie\" width=\"550\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/hqdefault-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.biography.com\/people\/justin-bieber-522504\">Justin Bieber<\/a> vs. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jay_Park\">Jay Park<\/a>: which one is American and which one is the foreigner?<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, the Ghost in the Shell movie and its Whitewashing has clear implications that affect actual people; simply put, White actors\u00a0are &#8220;stealing&#8221; Asian American jobs.

They fought alongside fellow Americans that treated them as second-class citizens based upon their race alone. Today, we let this practice of alienation and discrimination continue. Whitewashing is one of these ways; appropriating the extremely few roles written for Asians by\u00a0passing them out to Whites. Whites often do not *need* these roles; their stories are already consistently told in all forms of media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how does this and the Ghost in the Shell movie all tie into video games, anyway?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, this is where video games tend to differ &#8211; where Hollywood fails&#8230;ermm, Gamerwood? tends to succeed. Remember that fantastical freedom I mentioned earlier? Video game characters don&#8217;t need to\u00a0occupy physical space and whatnot; there&#8217;s really no limitations on what they can\u00a0look like. We see this more often with games that feature character customization; Elder Scrolls and Saints Row are some titles that let your character look like anything you&#8217;d like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PC gamers take this a step further with mods and suddenly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o7-hDQ-m6eY\">Spiderman<\/a>\u00a0is fighting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QlJULk0f9xA\"><del datetime=\"2016-09-22T05:23:33+00:00\">Alduin<\/del>\u00a0Randy Savage<\/a>. In my playthroughs of Saints Row IV, the President will always be a smoking hot buxom blonde. She&#8217;ll always wear nothing but pasties and a thong. Why? Because it&#8217;s hilarious to me that the POTUS can be practically naked. No one bats an eye or honks a boob; at least, until they get on the ship and&#8230;well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OTwFNKF8qPc\">bat eyes and honk boobs<\/a>.

This by itself is great, but there&#8217;s an incredible beauty to it. NPCs usually interact with them in the same manner despite\u00a0their appearance. The same dialogue that a stereotypical leading male character would receive occurs even if my character looks completely different. She could be Stripperella or\u00a0Rosie O&#8217;Donnell and she&#8217;ll garner the same respect. In that sense, games achieve true equality, strangely enough; NPCs treat the character as an individual and not as a race\/gender combination. This means that video games have accomplished what Hollywood hasn&#8217;t. Remember to bring that gem up next time someone says video game character representation is sexist.<\/p>\n<p>But what about games that don&#8217;t feature character customization? Are we stuck with playing the same type of\u00a0stereotypical leading male character that plagues Hollywood?<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;not always. Certainly there will be\u00a0some overlap, but video games genres differ wildly from each other. Characters from video games based off movies or sports rely on the likenesses of their\u00a0real life counterparts. On the other hand, genres like JRPGs, RTS, and FPS tend to\u00a0feature diversity in the video game characters. Game developers, from indie to AAA, live all over the world; as such they make games that represent their worldview. This is often reflected in the characters they create. Japanese games are different than French games are different than American games; each country brings variety to their respective platforms, developing something for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>While this doesn&#8217;t always improve the diversity of experience &#8211; i.e., the games may feature a diverse representation of gender\/race combinations but the games themselves are still typically\u00a0aimed at a specific (male-oriented) audience &#8211; it achieves what Hollywood usually\u00a0does not. It achieves the representation of often marginalized groups of people that lend to an authentic, well-developed story. The diversity will never be perfect, but it&#8217;s certainly better than Hollywood&#8217;s standard M.O.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9319\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9319 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23-960x720.jpg\" alt=\"Painting Fence White Ghost in the shell movie\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23-960x720.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23-320x240.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23-640x480.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/unique-fence-paint-with-painted-and-stained-fences-in-oswego-montgomery-yorkville-from-capital-23.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sorry, we&#8217;re back; we missed a spot!<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what can Hollywood learn and apply to the Ghost in the Shell movie?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Hollywood can&#8217;t allow viewers to customize the main character to fit their wants\/needs; they can, however, start branching out of this mindset they&#8217;ve seemingly created for themselves. Why the mindset that says audience members only want a White\u00a0majority\u00a0onscreen exists I do not know.<\/p>\n<p>In truth,\u00a0I believe we actually\u00a0don&#8217;t care who we see on screen. We just want a good actor who\u00a0can portray their character in a believable manner. This goes for the Ghost in the Shell movie as well. To cast someone like Scarlett Johannson as Motoko Kusanagi represents the loss of one layer of authenticity.\u00a0Coupled with\u00a0the issues regarding Whitewashing, I find all of this to be a crime; a crime against a story I consider\u00a0almost sacred. This adaptation has me more disgusted than excited.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghost in the Shell is so quintessentially Japanese in a deep and contemplative way. As such, it has a hard time translating to non-Japanese adaptations.<\/span> It was &#8211; and is &#8211; an amazing manga and incredible\u00a0animated movie. But anything further than that and the original message of the story\u00a0is muddled.<\/p>\n<p>It requires the gentle touch of someone that understands what the manga was trying to convey. I daresay it\u2019s near impossible. But if any one group of people would be able to accomplish this, it would be the Japanese nationals. After all, this is their story!\u00a0As such, the Ghost in the Shell movie belongs to their\u00a0capable directors, producers, and actors.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live-action movies of animes are usually box-office bombs.<\/span> Even Asian foreign films, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0364569\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old Boy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Eye_(2002_film)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eye<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1321511\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usually<\/span><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0406759\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tank<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span> Going simply by the general trend, the Ghost in the Shell movie will too. It simply isn\u2019t going to have the same profundity and complexity\u00a0that the original had.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the problem begins with Whitewashing; the inability for casting directors to see an Asian actor in an Asian role. Another part of the issue is\u00a0a vague, partial understanding of the cultural conversation at the time. This is something that a Japanese person living in the &#8217;90s would easily comprehend that Americans wouldn\u2019t totally grasp.<\/p>\n<p>Ghost in the Shell represents what might have been; a dystopian future based off Japanese fears, thoughts, emotions, and imaginations. Perhaps the message best belongs\u00a0in their hands; untouched and unblemished by well-meaning yet culturally ignorant outsiders who cannot possibly recreate that level of greatness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Never miss another article &#8211; like us on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/equityarcade\/\">FaceBook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EquityArcade\">Twitter<\/a>.

Players take control of a civilization based on real-life dynasties; starting from prehistory, they develop their nation\u2019s cities, armies, technology and more in a contest against other key leaders\u00a0with the same goal: world domination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That glorious DOS-based\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2Vl1DvlVj_M\">first iteration<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Civilization_(video_game)\">won more awards than Meryl Streep<\/a>. It&#8217;s undeniably\u00a0one of the most influential video games in history. In the past quarter-century, players have logged an estimated billion (yes, with a \u2018b\u2019) hours of gameplay on the dozen-plus iterations and expansion packs, courtesy of Micropose and Firaxis. This October, the sixth official version will hit the shelves. Millions of players should begin preparing for a voluntary vitamin D deficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s really no wonder Civilization is one of the most played titles of all times. Each game is completely different &#8212; what with different maps and victory strategies and enemy configurations. There\u2019s quite literally an infinite amount of possibilities in any one Civ title.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9309\" style=\"width: 808px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9309\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10.png\" alt=\"Mahatma Gandhi nuclear civ meme\" width=\"798\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10.png 798w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10-320x227.png 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10-768x544.png 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screenshot_10-640x453.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">One thing, however, remains constant: <a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/2016\/08\/18\/unfinished-how-broken-mechanics-made-good-games-great\/\">Nuclear Gandhi<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is interesting. Because if any one purchased Civ game offers a virtually unlimited play-hours-to-dollar ratio, what keeps the die-hard fans buying the new titles?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few other video game series can claim such a long and storied run, but Mario and Zelda come to mind. Both have been around for decades, both have diehard fan bases, and both sell bajillions (yes, with a \u2018b\u2019) annually. But with a few exceptions, these are linear play-throughs that take an average player X amount of hours to complete. They don\u2019t offer the infinite possibilities of Civ.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular online games haven\u2019t been around as long but are perhaps more parallel. Case in point, WoW and Call of Duty. But even in these dynamic examples, you\u00a0play in a world of the designer\u2019s creation. And on top of that, what\u2019s keeping the gameplay differentiated are the other human players; Civ is completely unpredictable even in single player. It&#8217;s almost as if there&#8217;s no need a multiplayer option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Fun and\/or depressing side note: Sid Meier originally had no intention to incorporate multiplayer.

Game designers Bruce Shelley, Sid Meier, Brian Reynolds, and Soren Johnson were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h65FXaJHbhE\">discussing Civ\u2019s immortality<\/a>. Their secret, in so many words, is evolving &#8220;just enough&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson elaborated, saying that in recent years they\u2019d adopted a new policy. \u201dOne-third old, one-third improved, and one-third new.\u201d Meier himself agreed.\u00a0\u201cSome franchises go into overly large, overly complex ideas and crashed and burned.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9312\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-9312\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU-960x544.jpeg\" alt=\"No Man's Sky Art\" width=\"768\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU-960x544.jpeg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU-320x181.jpeg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU-768x435.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU-640x362.jpeg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/vYVZabrC5BZb5tbEJNGfuU.jpeg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mmhmm&#8230;<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you look at the series\u2019 evolution, it&#8217;s easy to\u00a0see how that strategy has been implemented. Outside the continual and dramatic cosmetic improvements, each iteration carries over the same basic gameplay tenants. Yet each one adds new elements that improve, or a the very least change, the experience for the hardcore fans. Civ 1 didn\u2019t even have hit points; there were only two paths to victory in Civ 2. Culture didn\u2019t exist until Civ 3 and Religion only became a major tool for 4. And after 19 successful years with millions of sales, Civ 5 introduced a completely revamped combat system. And those are only the flashiest adjustments to the major titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this manner, Civ remains relevant but is poised as fresh and different. Every new Civ is current and exciting enough for new players, but familiar enough to the old warhorses. Which brings us to the million-dollar question: how is that strategy implemented\u00a0for Civ 6?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simultaneously boring-yet-exciting development is that Workers are finally gone, replaced with a more complicated \u2018Builder\u2019 unit. Then there\u2019s cities \u2013 for the first time ever, your buildings and developments don\u2019t all live on a single tile. Much of Civ 5\u2019s combat features will carry over, with a few tweaks. But early play testers have widely commented on the improved, more dynamic diplomacy options.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9314\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-9314\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak-960x617.jpg\" alt=\"Nuclear Civ Mahatma Gandhi Meme\" width=\"768\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak-960x617.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak-320x206.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak-768x494.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak-640x411.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/OAJstak.jpg 1089w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;diplomacy&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then there\u2019s the vague yet seemingly major addition of \u2018Active Progression\u2019. According to lead designer Ed Beach, \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that having your units and cities achieve successes helps your civ unlock technological secrets and build a strong society.\u201d Meaning that, in the case of the Sailing and Navigation Technologies, you get boosts for having boats and cities on the coast, as opposed to completely landlocked civilizations. There\u2019ll be similar bonus systems for all technologies; this Active Progression will likely affect many other facets of the game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019ll of course be more surprises waiting for players this October (rumors of a new victory condition abound). But looking at the formula for Civ 6 thus far, we can expect what\u2019s worked for the past 25 years: evolving just enough.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is good.

Despite belonging to the LJN family, could the beloved franchise overpower the absolute garbage of its published brothers and sisters and set a shining example of a game based off a movie that, for once, isn&#8217;t absolutely godawful?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns out it sucks.

It\u00a0even received\u00a0the attention of YouTube personalities such as\u00a0James Rolfe (the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dfs6TFqg0cU\">Angry Video Game Nerd<\/a>)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its atrociously horrendous gameplay. Complaints are diverse yet similar in their disdain for the title &#8211; &#8220;too difficult&#8221;, &#8220;shoddy transition from movie to game&#8221;, and &#8220;repetitive music score and frustrating gameplay&#8221; were among the many scathing reviews it received in its lifetime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1989 was quite a long time ago and the video game industry certainly\u00a0grew up in the past quarter century; with that being said, games based off movies are still as terrible as ever, and horror games are no exception.\u00a0Isn&#8217;t it about time that a classic horror series, whether it be Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elm Street, gets a video game that actually appeals to fans and gamers? After the decades of shit that&#8217;s been shoveled our way, we deserve better!\u00a0I know some of us would straight up kill someone for a good psychopathic horror game (see what we did there). Why hasn&#8217;t our nightmarish dream been realized?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that time has finally come: a <a href=\"http:\/\/f13game.com\/\">REAL Friday the 13th <\/a>game will soon be upon us, and with the success that Dead by Daylight had we can hope to see some great mechanics &#8211; particularly with its use of asymmetrical gameplay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.1up.com\/features\/what-the-hell-is-asymmetric-gameplay\">Asymmetrical gameplay<\/a> isn&#8217;t used often, and when it is it often requires\u00a0fine tuning.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/the-awkward-asymmetry-of-evolve\/\">Evolve&#8217;s asymmetry was clunky and awkward<\/a>,\u00a0and the fanbase fell off quickly because of the price and lack of gameplay\/content. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/steamspy.com\/app\/381210\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dead by Daylight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was much more reasonably priced, unassumingly released its beta to wild success -players jumped on board immediately and have faithfully remained as more patches and content have been released&#8230;for free. Dead by Daylight proves that this type of gameplay can be done well and can bring in a huge following, even with those not fans of the horror genre,\u00a0simply due to great mechanics, incentives, and never forgetting that a game must be fun for it to succeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9288\" style=\"width: 888px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9288 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download.jpg\" alt=\"Dead By Daylight cover art killer survivors bear trap escape art friday the 13th game\" width=\"878\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download.jpg 878w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download-320x161.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download-768x387.jpg 768w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dead-By-Daylight-Setup-Free-Download-640x323.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Escaping the clutches of a homicidal psycho maniac?\u00a0Apparently this is a common\u00a0way to spend a Friday night!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A good horror game series is hard to develop and produce without becoming trite and pointless. The original Nintendo Friday the 13th performed horribly, and fans of the films have not seen a game since then. This new title aims to resolve some of those previously existing issues and give gamers what they&#8217;ve always wanted. And did gamers want it? Well, the crowdfunding campaign alone speaks for itself. Friday the 13th game&#8217;s Illfonic attained\u00a0their original goal within one month back in 2015. The game was\u00a0jointly funded by the websites Backerkit and Kickstarter with\u00a0over $1 million in donations raised.<\/p>\n<p>With the gap in time we have witnessed and the funding that so many fans put forth, one would think that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.illfonic.com\/\">Illfonic<\/a> has devoted\u00a0the necessary time to create the game that all the backers wanted. Despite the time and funds, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/2016\/06\/24\/mighty-no-9-shows-us-the-most-disastrous-game-release-ever\/\">horror stories of crowdfunding gone wrong<\/a> aren&#8217;t in the too distant past. Can Illfonic make the game of our dreams that will forever\u00a0haunt our nightmares?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily,\u00a0it\u00a0looks like Illfonic will deliver; the new Friday the 13th game appears to have everything horror fans are simply <em>dying<\/em>\u00a0for. It will be a survival horror where players are\u00a0pitted against a PC that\u00a0controls Jason Voorhees. A cult classic character murdering some stupid teenage counselors from yesteryear\u00a0in the true-to-film fashion we&#8217;ve all come to know and love (and fear)? Sounds like a solid game! Admittedly, the gameplay footage has been a bit vanilla. But the right idea is there and there&#8217;s no reason not to be hopeful. \u00a0If the gameplay ends up like what we have seen in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JXm3KBybpgk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alpha footage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we can expect some white-knuckled, edge of your seat fear that will drive the gamer to level up their counselors so that Jason won&#8217;t murder them in his infamous style.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ecF59xvFZvQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Just watching this footage makes me realize how terrifyingly realistic the game actually is. Not so much in graphics, although sweet baby Jesus are they better than the NES days. But in that familiar increase in heartrate, small rush of adrenaline, and sweaty palms (sorry). Calm down, run away, and try to distract Jason as much as you can to survive; honestly, you&#8217;re already dead and just don\u2019t know it. Good luck, fellow counselors; as a fan of the series myself, I&#8217;ll be there alongside\u00a0everyone else, fleeing from terrible\u00a0danger.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shit, I think he is already here!

These patterns have been so consistent over such an extended period of time that, when the stimuli, criteria, or events are recreated in a clinical setting, researchers have observed the behavior that happens naturally time and time again and have concluded that humans &#8220;just do this thing&#8221; because &#8220;that&#8217;s what humans do&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>For example &#8211; we know that children learn through imitation thanks to a very famous study by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psychologicalscience.org\/index.php\/publications\/observer\/obsonline\/bandura-and-bobo.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bandura<\/a>.

One group of children was left alone in the room while the other group watched as an adult mercilessly flogged poor Bobo\u00a0and then subsequently left after their apparent rage-filled therapy session.

Perhaps Skyrim should have been named after that town as well, because everyone and their dog likes to think that they can take on the Dovahkiin and win. It&#8217;s understandable at the beginning of the game when the word hasn&#8217;t traveled yet that this random guy shouts followers off mountaintops for fun and, when he gets around to it, defeats dragons out of annoyance rather than necessity, but once the player has logged thirty or so hours (or one sitting), the NPCs should really start catching on.

While there are some unique items that are worth collecting or weapons that do so much damage that it would be foolish to explore the wasteland without them, there&#8217;s a fine line between &#8220;collecting&#8221; items and &#8220;hoarding&#8221; them.<\/p>\n<p>Fallout 4 makes players take that line and shoves it so far up Bethesda&#8217;s ass they&#8217;ll see another Elder Scrolls game before that line sees the light of day again.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not really sure what we said, but what we mean is that it&#8217;s really easy to think that every item the protagonist comes across seems useful in some way. While this applies to all games, this franchise takes it a step further in that there&#8217;s a) so many goddamn items &amp; b) the whole post-apocalyptic setting really sets the tone for this illusion of scarcity and literally anything seems valuable.<\/p>\n<p>Just consider for a second the environment outside the context from the game and think about how life would be if this was reality. Bottle caps, once considered trash, are now currency. Bottled, clean water would be worth its weight in gold if that was still a viable measurement of value. And don&#8217;t even get us started on settlements &#8211; in order to build actual ones, reusing everything suddenly becomes less a frivolous goal and more of an actual survival strategy.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9275\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-9275 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies-960x594.jpg\" alt=\"Beanie Babies Worth Today\" width=\"768\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies-960x594.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies-320x198.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies-640x396.jpg 640w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Beanies.jpg 1503w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Except Beanie Babies.

After all, these items are universally super important, right?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that the items are used to build settlements and whatnot, but let&#8217;s get real &#8211; there comes a time when items are no longer being picked up because they&#8217;re needed and moreso because it&#8217;s a compunction. What&#8217;s interesting is this, coupled with the fact that NPCs rarely bother collecting even .1% of what the protagonist does,\u00a0illustrates\u00a0Aberrant Salience*.

The Sole Survivor wanders the wasteland doing various quests and collects items along the way. There are usually NPCs along the journey, and these NPCs are often capable of bending over and picking up the same items the character picks up &#8211; the question is, why haven&#8217;t they? They could be lazy and would rather someone else come do it or run their errands or save their settlements, but Aberrant Salience would dictate that the items in question were never important to begin with. NPCs weren&#8217;t picking up the items because they were physically incapable &#8211; they simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered to collect what amounted to garbage.

But more often than not, the (un)lucky testers come away\u00a0with conflicted feelings.<\/p>\n<p>First, there\u2019s the \u2018uncanny valley\u2019 syndrome \u2013 when a virtual experience is very close\u00a0to reality, any noticeable flaws become magnified and psychologically more\u00a0disturbing. Imagine being incredibly immersed in a POV scene \u2013 how 99% of VR\u00a0porn is currently being filmed \u2013 and you fully believe this blonde is on top of you,\u00a0when all of the sudden she leans in and, per lens warp, just grew like Apache Chief.\u00a0Or, how about if \u2018your\u2019 arm moves into frame, even though you did nothing with that\u00a0arm IRL? If \u2018immersive\u2019 is the big selling point, these videos aren\u2019t there yet.<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s adapting for different sexualities. In traditional porn, you simply\u00a0shoot whatever combinations of genitals and orientations you want and boom, good\u00a0to go. But for VR POV, it\u2019s trickier. If your fantasy digital partner is behind you, how\u00a0do you see them?<\/p>\n<p>The industry\u2019s also catching flak for not having nearly enough material for straight\u00a0women yet. In the good ol\u2019 days, a straight couple going at it in a film could work for\u00a0either a straight male or female viewer \u2013 but no longer. What\u2019s more, several women\u00a0who have experienced VR sex with a man became discomforted by the lack of\u00a0control, drawing similarities to rape.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9238\" style=\"width: 980px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9238\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies.jpg\" alt=\"cute bunnies outside easter spring rabbits\" width=\"970\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies.jpg 970w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies-320x180.jpg 320w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies-960x541.jpg 960w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Bunnies-640x361.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cue bunny photo to offset unpleasantness.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>When Al Gore called the internet into existence, the porn industry simply uploaded\u00a0the decades of material they already owned, and told us to have fun. With VR,\u00a0they\u2019re having to start all over again. And they\u2019re not quite sure how to do it yet.<\/p>\n<p>But the internet, even if it wasn\u2019t covered in carnal acts, would have been a success\u00a0on its own. All the world\u2019s collective knowledge at the touch of a few buttons, access\u00a0to friends and family from anywhere on the globe, and cat videos galore? The\u00a0internet was never going to not be a thing.<\/p>\n<p>Many say the same is true of VR. It may not be tomorrow, or as early as investors\u00a0would have liked, but expectations remain sky high for the platform&#8217;s growth over\u00a0the next 5 years.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; there&#8217;s the occasional amazing sidekick that you really can&#8217;t imagine playing\u00a0without, like <a href=\"http:\/\/masseffect.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tali'Zorah_nar_Rayya\" target=\"_blank\">Tali&#8217;Zorah<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/theportalwiki.com\/wiki\/Weighted_Companion_Cube\" target=\"_blank\">the Companion Cube<\/a>,\u00a0and it&#8217;s really hard to screw up a horse, like <a href=\"http:\/\/teamico.wikia.com\/wiki\/Agro\" target=\"_blank\">Agro<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/zeldawiki.org\/Epona\" target=\"_blank\">Epona<\/a>. But too many games seem to throw in a half-baked character that is sorely underdeveloped or incredibly annoying that you&#8217;ll do your best to beat it\u00a0without them, if possible (we&#8217;re looking at you, <a href=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1xvtGRb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Lydia<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nEnSYOhMypQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>But even Lydia had her moments &#8211; at least she was sworn to carry your burdens.

He is embarrassingly terrible in battle and never truly becomes useful, except for when he plays his harp from a safe distance 1,000 miles away to end the Dark Elf\u2019s Magic. In battle, he does no damage and has the appropriately useless \u201chide\u201d ability. He might as well hide the entire time he is in the party because he is a worthless coward who was responsible for\u00a0his lover Anna&#8217;s murder. So not only can he not fight, he actually ends up getting people killed, which is the exact opposite in what adventuring parties tend to want in a companion. As a prince who was raised in nobility and received an education based around the idea of protecting his people, how could he let Anna die? No wonder Tellah wanted to seek revenge on the weak turd that put his daughter six feet under &#8211; he&#8217;s a crappy prince who ran away to play his harp too much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Riki &#8211; Xenoblade Chronicles<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Riki.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9216\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Riki.png\" alt=\"Riki companion sucks\" width=\"515\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Riki.png 515w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Riki-320x265.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This terrible companion only goes by one name: Riki. Riki is a legendary hero from\u00a0the Frontier Village on Bionis. An annoying voice, people, and prophecy plague this companion on his journey, because of course a great JRPG on the Wii has to have irritating\u00a0characters that are directly involved in the plot. It&#8217;s like a prerequisite or something. Anyway, he&#8217;s a bumbling idiot that\u00a0eats too much and is infuriatingly accompanied by\u00a0eleven\u00a0children that will enrage\u00a0the crap out of the player during every cutscene (guess no one taught this guy to wrap it before he taps it). If that wasn&#8217;t enough, Riki likes to reminisce about\u00a0parts of his life that are not only irrelevant\u00a0but drone on for so long that the player may forget why\u00a0they started playing Xenoblade Chronicles in the first place. It&#8217;s almost like the developers thought &#8220;well, we&#8217;re here, why not\u00a0give an already annoying companion even more awful traits and flaws?&#8221;. \u00a0Riki, seriously, please shut the hell up (and invest in some condoms!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Graham &#8211; Resident Evil 4<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Ashley.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9217\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Ashley.png\" alt=\"Ashley graham resident evil sucks\" width=\"556\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Ashley.png 556w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Ashley-320x290.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Resident Evil 4, Leon S. Kennedy is sent to Europe to save the American president&#8217;s daughter, Ashley. The game never does elaborate on exactly how she got kidnapped, but judging by her Britney Spears-esque costume and her general uselessness, it&#8217;s doubtful it was a goodwill-mission-gone-wrong. Turns out not only is she an aggravatingly annoying little girl who is practically a walking stereotype of a damsel in distress, but she doesn&#8217;t do a single thing to protect herself the entire game. You&#8217;d think an adult who&#8217;s been on this green Earth for twenty-something years would develop a sense of self-preservation, but at no point does she ask for a gun or knife to protect herself from various cultists and monsters. Nope, she\u2019s good, she&#8217;ll just hide in a box or run down a platform completely out in the open (which are two wildly different things, mind you). Even when she is being grabbed at by ravenous, murderous enemies, she makes no attempt to get away or dodge any kind of attack. I suppose she does get some credit for getting the radiation surgery to remove the plagas from her chest, as that would hurt terribly, but not much, because it doesn&#8217;t do enough to override her general inability to be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Navi &#8211; Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Navi.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9218\" src=\"http:\/\/media.equityarcade.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Navi.png\" alt=\"Navi Legend of Zelda Link Ocarina of TIme OOT Hey Listen Hey Watch Out Hey\" width=\"563\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Navi.png 563w, http:\/\/tan.equityarcade.com\/media\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Navi-320x217.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=seKaU-qQuts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HEY LISTEN!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Navi just has to be on the list; everyone hates her (if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re wrong.

Everyone remembers the crew of FF7 and how each character affects the story, like when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tWVdv4Qalcg\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud gets molested in a questionable bath house<\/a> or when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8XjHuNJOy_4\" target=\"_blank\">Aeris dies<\/a> (TOO SOON). When it comes to Cait Sith, most gamers agree that the only effect&#8230;it? he? had was being terrible &#8211; not only in battle but during the story\u00a0as well. While visiting Gold Saucer for the first time, he immediately decides to join the quest to save the world and gives Aeris that\u00a0awful fortune telling her she is going to die (thanks for that nugget of joy, Cait Sith).\u00a0Cait Sith can best be described as\u00a0a giant, ugly, fat polygonal Moogle serving as a beast of burden to\u00a0a malnourished cat that desperately needs attention. Cait Sith is controlled by a Shinra Turk named <a href=\"http:\/\/finalfantasy.wikia.com\/wiki\/Reeve_Tuesti\">Reeve Tuesti<\/a>,\u00a0initially stealing from Cloud and the party to help Shinra then threatening the group, forcing Cloud&amp;Co.&#8217;s hand when it wasn&#8217;t necessary. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In battle, all of Cait Sith&#8217;s weapons and limit breaks are appallingly godawful to the point where players will refuse to use him. His stupidity is sprinkled here and there throughout the plot and every time he speaks, gamers wish there was a way to set him ablaze.

Certainly the thought\u00a0must have\u00a0crossed your mind as you conquer enemy-filled dungeons or waste zombies\/vampires\/whatevs. Working in video games would definitely be a dream job, but&#8230;well, what would that job be? Programming? Writing? Marketing? Audio Design? Working in games doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean playing them&#8230;you&#8217;re either creating them or supporting those who create in some way. All video game-related jobs are important, and games as we know them wouldn&#8217;t get made without everyone doing their part.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a part that some of you may or may not have considered before: Audio\u00a0Design. It permeates literally everything in gaming &#8211; the very first video games featured beeps and boops, while the games of today have more advanced sound effects &#8211; all of them holding the possibility to become iconic. What is the noise\u00a0you hear when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o3Tlv7h9I3Y\" target=\"_blank\">Mario gets a 1UP<\/a>? How does Kirby sound when he is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-omZ9OJt1lc\" target=\"_blank\">inhaling deeply<\/a>?

Certainly many sounds flooded your mind as you remembered ones that you&#8217;d heard time and time again. Each effect, noise, cry, and everything in between was created by an audio designer in the process called audio\u00a0design.<\/p>\n<p>I have cool friends, and one of those friends happens to be an audio artist for Electronic Arts (EA). Literally living all my childhood dreams and more, Michelle was gracious enough to accept an interview on what&#8217;s like to work in audio\u00a0design and how one might be able to follow in her footsteps (we highlighted some key points we thought were really important!).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>So what is audio\u00a0design?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/videos.company3.com\/2014\/04\/SoundDesign.jpg\" alt=\"sound design video games rainbow waves\" width=\"680\" height=\"445\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Audio\u00a0design is the process of manipulating, generating, creating, and editing audio. Many people may not realize it, but a lot goes into audio\u00a0design in a lot of things we hear everyday. Television, animation, movies, theater, video games, etc. Someone has to watch those golf games and make sure the audio is on par and meeting specs for television. Someone has to make sound for those explosions in the Michael Bay movies. And whether it\u2019s someone going out and recording sound in the real world, doing foley, or mixing sounds together, it\u2019s all a part of audio\u00a0design.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>How did you become interested in audio design? How did you even find out about it being a job?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.asoundeffect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/audio_podcast.jpg\" alt=\"sound design video games microphone mic\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I have always been tinkering around with sound. My whole family plays an instrument, so I grew up watching my mom play piano and organ and my dad play the drums. I also grew up watching my Dad play video games, and then my brother and I would constantly play video games. It was Final Fantasy 7 when I realized how much emphasis on sound there was on games.\u00a0In addition to video games, I was raised on the\u00a0violin and piano and was constantly in all the orchestra classes from elementary school to high school. It was in high school that I was introduced to Garage Band in my multimedia class and I was hooked. I was constantly putting loops together and making music. In college, as I was figuring out what I wanted to be my first year, my mom called me and was super excited. She said she found out that the University of Utah was offering a degree in video games. Of course I was intrigued! I\u2019ve been playing games my whole life. So, I signed up.<\/p>\n<p>The University of Utah offered an engineering path and an art path. Sadly, no audio\u00a0path was available. I took the art path and studied 3D modeling and animation. Going through it, I realized these games I was helping create couldn\u2019t just be silent, and the video game degree didn\u2019t offer any audio\u00a0design courses. It was at that moment I decided \u00a0that I would take up audio\u00a0design; <em><strong>I began teaching myself what I needed to to know.<\/strong><\/em> At the start, I was just getting free sound samples online and mixing them together, but the more I progressed the more I learned. Later on,\u00a0I found out about Fruity Loops and I started using that to make music. Further down the line,\u00a0someone introduced me to East West and Sounds Online &#8211; from that point on, I was obsessed. I bought the Gold Strings and from there my obsession really took off. I was suddenly the audio\u00a0designer for almost all the games being made in my classes and I became known as \u201cThe Sound Girl\u201d. I loved it and continued doing audio\u00a0design wherever I could.<\/p>\n<p>The University of Utah also offers a masters degree in video gaming, so I decided to take that to hone my skills more and connect with more people. At that point, I was still on the art side of things and was focusing on animation and becoming an animator. I found out the film school offered one sound course, so\u00a0I jumped right on that; still, it was only one course, so <em><strong>I kept forcing myself to learn and to help in all the projects I could<\/strong><\/em>. In my last year of the masters degree, my counselor e-mailed me saying that Electronic Art\u2019s studio, Mythic, was looking for audio interns. I was so excited I quickly applied and&#8230;I got it! They said I sounded so excited about the job that they knew I\u2019d work hard. I moved to Virginia and worked with Mythic for a few months. When I moved back to Utah to get married, a year later I was called up and was told the Electronic Arts office in Salt Lake city needed an audio designer and I was able to nail the job. I have been working there since.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>What steps did you have to take in order to get a job in audio\u00a0design? School? Extra-curriculars?

There was one class at the U of U for sound, so I jumped on that right away. However, I mostly watched YouTube tutorials, messed around in Fruity Loops constantly, and did as many projects as I could. When I was being interviewed for Mythic, I studied their games and made sure I had questions to ask. When I asked why I was hired, my boss said that the two people\u00a0he hired (myself and another person) were the only ones who sounded excited about the job and asked questions. <em><strong>He knew I was ready to learn and work hard.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Describe a typical day in the life of a audio\u00a0designer.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/www.neonvox.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/SoundDesign3.jpg\" alt=\"sound design video games audio wave mixer\" width=\"935\" height=\"502\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For an audio designer for mobile video games, I come into work, attend stand-ups where I hear what people are working on (lets me know if something is ready for audio), then I get to my office and see what animation, VFX, or UI need audio cues. I usually get a playblast of animation or in-game capture of VFX. This is where the fun starts! I have a library of hundreds of audio cues that I can edit and master together for our game\u2019s needs to make what I think the animation or VFX or buttons sound like. Once I get something together, I get feedback and tweak it as necessary. I also need to make sure it\u2019s in specs (not peaking, the EQ is fine, etc).. From there, I render them out, put it in our middleware (I\u2019m currently using FMOD Studio), and then put it in our game engine and hook it up appropriately. If it\u2019s something too complicated, I work with our programmers to get the audio hooked up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>What is your favorite part about audio\u00a0design?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/udemy-images.udemy.com\/course\/750x422\/339406_dd02_4.jpg\" alt=\"synthesizer sound design video games synthetic sounds\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The creation: I\u2019m building what our games&#8217; sound like, what the environments sound like, what everything sounds like!

Reruns of shows that had nothing to do with gaming ended up on G4 (Cops, Nightrider, or Lost) and killed the once great channel off. These shows didn&#8217;t appeal to the demographic of \u201cgamers\u201d and could have been aired on any number of broadcasting companies were added for rerun use and pure mediocrity. So we even though we know <a href=\"https:\/\/equityarcade.com\/2016\/02\/15\/why-g4-failed-television-and-gaming\/\" target=\"_blank\">why G4TV failed<\/a>, we saw some great original shows broadcasted (until the station decided to give them the axe).<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 675px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http:\/\/image.prntscr.com\/image\/a8290b8d4ba5406fa2c9c1ee172eda9c.png\" alt=\"G4 x-play attack of the show olivia munn\" width=\"665\" height=\"444\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">No wait, come back! Can\u2019t we talk about this?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Are we able to create any other gamer-centric channel without management mucking up everything before the channel truly takes off? Could anyone spend the time to actually create quality content that would travel through the appropriate filters before being aired? The answer is yes &#8211; and with the use of Twitch and YouTube, personalities of all kinds have been able to demonstrate their ability to entertain and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_u5dtBtG9yU\" target=\"_blank\">provide great substance<\/a>. But, even with these great online options, it seems that the gaming community is falling into the same trap G4 couldn\u2019t avoid.<\/p>\n<p>Take ScrewAttack as an example for new online entertainment. Screw Attack began in 2006, bringing forth the podcast SideScrollers which was created by their parent company Rooster Teeth (Red vs. Blue). We had a different medium for gaming entertainment and things seemed to go well in the first few years between the podcast and shows that were aired. One major difference between using YouTube and Cable TV as the entertainment medium has changed the way we as a society watch and intake our entertainment. All of a sudden we have an online gaming show that doesn&#8217;t have a single commercial about Tide Bleach or how Geico will save you from offending a caveman, or whatever.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 675px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http:\/\/image.prntscr.com\/image\/4af67db9fdf04a4da01bfece854c8c04.png\" alt=\"Geico caveman being offended\" width=\"665\" height=\"444\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Survival of the thickest skin, Neanderthal.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This was majorly impactful on how the community viewed TV and videos, as we no longer were required to watch needless commercials that had zero relevance to G4TV. Slowly over the years, more and more people have strayed away from cable TV and found other entertainment mediums (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, etc) because the consumer now has a say in what they watch and pay for. This power over what the viewer watches and takes in became a major reason why G4TV failed; no one wanted to pay for extra channels when all they were going to watch was HBO and G4TV.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch is the finest example of this idea: Twitch launched in 2011 as an internet streaming client where gamers could watch a host play and beat games that they streamed. Paying $5 gets you extra benefits within a channel and supports an entertainer doing what they know and love. This idea is the polar opposite of cable TV: instead of paying one fee for channels in bulk, you pay for a single channel instead of multiple channels &#8211; most of which you will never even look at. Ideas like this could never thrive on network television because, as a station, they have to pull in a certain number of views per show and channel to make their mark. Jane Doe on Twitch just wants $80 donated so she can get a better microphone to provide better quality entertainment on her stream. Viewers don&#8217;t mind throwing her a buck to two to support the cause. Seeing Twitch and YouTube thrive will change the way we view our entertainment as gamers, and really, as a society.<\/p>\n<p>Here is where we run into issues with Network TV crossing lines with YouTube shows and personalities. ScrewAttack was purchased by <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2014\/03\/28\/digital-media-firm-fullscreen-acquires-gamer-web-site-screwattack\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fullscreen in 2014<\/a>. Why does this matter? Well, if you research some of FullScreen\u2019s regularly scheduled programs, they include <em>Dawson\u2019s Creek<\/em> and <em>Saved by the Bell<\/em>. Granted, they rarely show those 90\u2019s cringe-nostalgic shows that really knew how to reach into your belly and cause you to vomit, but it&#8217;s not hard to see ScrewAttack go down that same road due to the same type of poor and misguided management that ultimately ended G4TV. This is something the gaming community fears the most: seeing their entertainers get slowly purchased by larger companies, only for the entertainment to change to what the larger companies standards are.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 675px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http:\/\/image.prntscr.com\/image\/6183b516380545f2badd8dba341bb15b.png\" alt=\"Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek Crying Meme\" width=\"665\" height=\"444\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh great, big networks, look &#8211; you\u2019ve gone and made Dawson cry again.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>There is a balance YouTubers and online personalities try to have between making a living and providing entertainment. James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, has done this quite successfully with Cinemassacre. Worth nearly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.celebritynetworth.com\/richest-celebrities\/actors\/james-rolfe-net-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">$100,000<\/a>, he has properly executed a way to make a good living and provide quality viewing with each new episode he creates. The Angry Video Game Nerd has been around for over 10 years and has not fallen down the same trap at G4TV did.<\/p>\n<p>Could we see another G4 or G4TV? One could argue that we are currently living in it, between Twitch and YouTube\u2019s success and their ability to bring in more viewers every day. Consumers now have the choice in what they watch, listen to, and read every day, which is significantly different from 10 years ago. Gamers can pay $5 to support an entertainer they like and get extra benefits with the subscription, along with chatting with viewers who are there for the same reason. Gamers get to watch as retro and new games are reviewed and played and are there on the ground level watching it live and contributing. People still want G4TV to come back, but really, it already has and it&#8217;s greater than ever before. Sit back and enjoy &#8211; we as a society no longer have to pay for the entertainment and television we didn&#8217;t care about; we now get to pay for what we truly want. What a time to be alive.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are no shows on cable television for gamers anymore.

With its Kickstarter campaign skyrocketing past $500K, this action survival certainly looks to be the next big hit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hzDl2THyF4w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I had to reveal the trailer as early as possible this time around. It&#8217;s just so damn good. The snow, the graphics, the music, and the art direction&#8230; all these aspects\u00a0can easily force a jaw to drop with its gravitational pull. And yeah, know that this game is absolutely 100 percent indie; it&#8217;s totally real, and this game is heading our way.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So besides the setting being cast in an eternal winter wonderland, what can one expect out of <em>Prey for the Gods<\/em> in terms of the story and the gameplay?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, for one, you&#8217;re a lone wolf who is sent to the edge of a dying world to uncover the reasoning behind the perpetual winter. You&#8217;re only equipped with clothes and nothing else. Matters only take a turn for the worse with the existence of gargantuan dangers that will <em>not<\/em> hesitate to murder you in the most gruesome way possible (being devoured is a good start).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The core feature to look forward to in <em>Prey for the Gods<\/em> is the colossal, epic battles with climbable giants. In other words, a feature that most definitely takes influence from the cult classic\u00a0<em>Shadow of the Colossus<\/em>.\u00a0Hell, if you haven&#8217;t noticed, even the art style is influenced by the title. It&#8217;s absolutely phenomenal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, you can&#8217;t forget about these included features, all of which &#8211; blended together, anyway &#8211; will make <em>Prey for the Gods<\/em> stick out like a sore thumb:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic snow terrain (instant desire right there, as I fucking love the snow).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intense survival gameplay.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploration of temples that are loaded with both secrets and treasure.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic day and night cycles, alongside dynamic weather.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-linear gameplay that will allow you to choose who and how to battle.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fallen hero locations. These heroes come with items ripe for scavenging, providing you with a survivability advantage.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And quite the intense musical score.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what about the gameplay? Are the battles similar to the battles ingrained in <em>Shadow of the Colossus<\/em>? Well, sort of. The battle system takes influences from not just <em>Shadow of the Colossus<\/em>, but also <em>Deus Ex<\/em>, <em>DayZ<\/em>, and <em>Bloodborne<\/em>. In other words, holy shit that&#8217;s a combination to anticipate, packed within tight controls executable with either keyboard or gamepad. It features the typical, &#8220;simple to learn, difficult to master&#8221; schemes, especially when you&#8217;re facing brutal giants that ultimately require creative strategy. That&#8217;s right, the game will work against you as you try to eradicate the giants. How so? Well, your weapons can break and the arrows are finite, so be careful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Prey for the Gods is accepting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.preyforthegods.com\/support_now\/\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal donations<\/a>, so if you want to support this game, it&#8217;s time to throw some sweet, dolla dolla bills at it.
